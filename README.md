# Web-Scraping-and-NLP-Text-Analysis-

## Objective:
* The objective of this project is to extract textual data articles from given URLs and perform text analysis to compute various variables. The project also involves sentimental analysis to determine the sentiment of financial texts.

## Data Extraction:

Use Python programming and libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests to read and extract the data from the given URL present in the dataset.

## Data Analysis:

Perform textual analysis on each extracted article text and compute variables in the datasets.
Utilize Python programming for data analysis.


## Output Variables:

* Perform sentiment analysis on financial texts using the provided algorithm.
* Clean the text using stop words lists to exclude irrelevant words.
* Create a dictionary of positive and negative words using the Master Dictionary.
* Calculate positive score, negative score, polarity score, and subjectivity score based on the presence of words in the positive and negative dictionaries.
* Analyze readability using the Gunning Fox index formula to calculate average sentence length, percentage of complex words, and the Fog Index.
* Determine average number of words per sentence, complex word count, word count (after removing stop words and punctuations), syllable count per word, personal pronouns count, and average word length.

### Sentimental Analysis:

Sentimental analysis determines whether a text is positive, negative, or neutral.
Clean the text using stop words lists.
Create a dictionary of positive and negative words using the Master Dictionary.
Calculate positive score, negative score, polarity score, and subjectivity score based on the presence of words in the positive and negative dictionaries.

### Analysis of Readability:

Calculate average sentence length and percentage of complex words.
Compute the Fog Index.

### Average Number of Words Per Sentence:

Calculate the average number of words per sentence by dividing the total number of words by the total number of sentences.

### Complex Word Count:

Count complex words with more than two syllables in the text.

### Word Count:

Count the total cleaned words in the text after removing stop words and punctuations.

### Syllable Count Per Word:

Count the number of syllables in each word by counting the vowels in the word.

### Personal Pronouns:

Use regex to find and count personal pronouns like "I," "we," "my," "ours," and "us" in the text.

### Average Word Length:

Calculate the average word length by dividing the total number of characters in each word by the total number of words.

### Overall, this project aims to extract data from URLs, perform text analysis, and compute various variables and sentiment scores using Python programming and relevant libraries.
