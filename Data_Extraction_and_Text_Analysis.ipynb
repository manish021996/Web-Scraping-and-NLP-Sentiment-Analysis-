people in the next few decades, it will be a highly infectious virus rather than a war. Not missiles but microbes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bill Gates\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remarks at a TED conference in 2014, right after the world had avoided the Ebola outbreak. When the new, unprecedented, invisible virus hit us, it met an overwhelmed and unprepared healthcare system and oblivious population. This public health emergency demonstrated our lack of scientific consideration and underlined the alarming need for robust innovations in our health and medical facilities. For the past few years, artificial intelligence has proven to be of tangible potential in the healthcare sectors, clinical practices, translational medical and biomedical research.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After the first case was detected in China on December 31st 2019, it was an AI program developed by BlueDot that alerted the world about the pandemic. It was quick to realise AI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to analyse large chunks of data could help in detecting patterns and identifying and tracking the possible carriers of the virus.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Many tracing apps use AI to keep tabs on the people who have been infected and prevent the risk of cross-infection by using AI algorithms that can track patterns and extract some features to classify or categorise them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>So how does AI do that?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>IBM Watson, a sophisticated AI that works on cloud computing and natural language processing, has prominently contributed to the healthcare sector on a global level. Being a conversational AI, since 2013, Watson has helped in recommending treatments to patients suffering from cancer to ensure that they get the best treatment at optimum costs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3277\" width=\"-417\" height=\"-203\" srcset=\"https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.jpg 945w, https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1-300x146.jpg 300w, https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1-768x375.jpg 768w, https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1-533x261.jpg 533w, https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1-696x340.jpg 696w, https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1-861x420.jpg 861w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 945px) 100vw, 945px\" /></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Researchers at Google Inc. showed that an AI system can be trained on thousands of images to achieve physician-level sensitivity.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>By identifying the molecular patterns associated with disease status and its subtypes, gene expression, and protein abundance levels, machine learning methods can detect fatal diseases like cancer at an early stage. Machine Learning (ML) techniques focus mainly on analyzing structured data, which can further help in clustering patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 traits and infer the probability of disease outcomes. Since patient traits mainly include masses of data relating to age, gender, disease history, disease-specific data like diagnostic imaging and gene expressions, etc, ML can extract features from these data inputs by constructing data analytical algorithms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>ML algorithms are either supervised or unsupervised. Unsupervised learning helps in extracting features and clustering similar features together that further leads to early detection of diseases. Clustering and principal component analysis enable grouping or clustering of similar traits together that are further used to maximize or minimize the similarity between the patients within or between the clusters. Since patient traits are recorded in multiple dimensions, such as genes, principal component analysis(PCA) creates the apparatus to reduce these dimensions which humans could have not done alone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Supervised learning considers the outcomes of the subjects together with the traits, and further correlates the inputs with the outputs to predict the probability of getting a particular clinical event, expected value of a disease level or expected survival time, or risk of Down\\xe2\\x80\\x99s syndrome.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Biomarker panels that are mostly used to detect ovarian cancer, have outperformed the conventional statistical methods due to machine learning. In addition to this, the use of EHRs and Bayesian networks, which are a part of supervised machine learning algorithms, can predict clinical outcomes and mortality respectively.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Unstructured data such as clinical notes and texts are converted into machine-readable structured data with the help of natural language processing(NLP). NLP works with two components: text processing and classification. Text processing helps in identifying a series of disease-relevant keywords in clinical notes and then through classification are further categorized into normal and abnormal cases. Chest screening through ML and NLP has helped find abnormalities in the lungs and provide treatment to covid patients. Healthcare organizations use NLP-based chatbots to increase interactions with patients, keeping their mental health and wellness in check.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Deep learning is a modern extension of the classical neural network techniques which helps explore more complex non-linear patterns in data, using algorithms like convolution neural network, recurrent neural network, deep belief network, and deep neural network which enables more accurate clinical prediction. When it comes to genome interpretation, deep neural networks surpass the conventional methods of logistics regression and support vector machines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Sepsis Watch is an AI system trained in deep learning algorithms that holds the capability to analyze over 32 million data points to create a patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s risk score and identify the early stages of sepsis.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another method known as the Learning-based Optimization of the Under Sampling Pattern( LOUPE) is based on integrating full resolution MRI scans with the convolutional neural network algorithm, which helps in creating more accurate reconstructions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Robotic surgery is widely considered in most delicate surgeries like gynaecology and prostate surgery. Even after striking the right balance between human decisions and AI precision, robotic surgery reduces surgeon efficiency as they have to be manually operated through a console. Thus, autonomous robotic surgery is on the rise with inventions such as robotic silicon fingers that mimic the sense of touch that surgeons need to identify organs, cut tissues, etc., or robotic catheters that can navigate whether it is touching blood, tissue, or valve.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Researchers at Children&#8217;s National Hospital, Washington have already developed an AI called Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR), which performs a colon anastomosis on its own with the help of an ML-powered suturing tool, that automatically detects the patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s breathing pattern to apply suture at the correct point.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" src=\"https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3278\" srcset=\"https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2.jpg 620w, https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-80x60.jpg 80w, https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-265x198.jpg 265w, https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-560x420.jpg 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /><figcaption>An image of STAR during surgery.</figcaption></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cloud computing in healthcare has helped in retrieving and sharing medical records safely with a reduction in maintenance costs. Through this technology doctors and various healthcare workers have access to detailed patient data that helps in speeding up analysis ultimately leading to better care in the form of more accurate information, medications, and therapies.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How can It help in Biomedical research?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since AI can analyze literature beyond readability, it can be used to concise biomedical research. With the help of ML algorithms and NLP, AI can accelerate screening and indexing of biomedical research, by ranking the literature of interest which allows researchers to formulate and test scientific hypotheses far more precisely and quickly. Taking it to the next level, AI systems like the computational modelling assistant (CMA) helps researchers to construct simulation models from the concepts they have in mind. Such innovations have majorly contributed to topics such as tumour suppressor mechanisms and protein-protein interaction information extraction.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>AI as precision medicine</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since precision medicine focuses on healthcare interventions to individuals or groups of patients based on their profile, the various AI devices pave the way to practice it more efficiently. With the help of ML, complex algorithms like large datasets can be used to predict and create an optimal treatment strategy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Deep learning and neural networks can be used to process data in healthcare apps and keep a close watch on the patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emotional state, food intake, or health monitoring.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOmics\\xe2\\x80\\x9d refers to the collective technologies that help in exploring the roles, relationships of various branches ending with the suffix \\xe2\\x80\\x9comics\\xe2\\x80\\x9d such as genomics, proteomics, etc. Omics-based tests based on machine learning algorithms help find correlations and predict treatment responses, ultimately creating personalized treatments for individual patients.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How it helps in psychology and neuro patients</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For psychologists studying creativity,&nbsp; AI is promising new classes of experiments that are developing data structures and programs and exploring novel theories on a new horizon. Studies show that &nbsp;AI can conduct therapy sessions, <a href=\"https://positivepsychology.com/e-therapy/\">e-therapy</a> sessions, and assessments autonomously, also assisting human practitioners before, during, or after sessions. The Detection and Computational Analysis of Psychological Signal project uses ML, computer vision, and NLP to analyze language, physical gestures, and social signals to identify cues for human distress. This ground-breaking technology assesses soldiers returning from combat and recognizes those who require further mental health support. In the future, it will combine data captured during face-to-face interviews with information on sleeping, eating, and online behaviours for a complete patient view.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Stroke identification</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Stroke is another frequently occurring disease that affects more than 500 million people worldwide. Thrombus,&nbsp; in the vessel cerebral infarction is the major (about 85%) cause of stroke occurrence. In recent years, AI techniques have been used in numerous stroke-related studies as early detection and timely treatment along with efficient outcome prediction can help solve the problem. With AI at our disposal, large amounts of data with rich information, more complications and real-life clinical questions can be addressed in this arena. Currently, two ML algorithms- genetic fuzzy finite state machine and PCA were implemented to build a model building solution. These include a human activity recognition stage and a stroke onset detection stage. An alert stroke message is activated as soon as a movement significantly different from the normal pattern is recorded. ML methods have been applied to neuroimaging data to assist disease evaluation and predicting stroke treatment for the diagnosis.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Patient Monitoring</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Today, the market for AI-based patient monitoring is impressive and monetarily enticing. It is evolving with artificial sensors, smart technologies and explores everything from brain-computer interfaces to nanorobotics. Companies with their smart-watches have engaged people to perform remote monitoring even when they are not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpatients\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. An obvious place to start is with wearable and embedded sensors, glucose monitors, pulse monitors, oximeters, and ECG monitors. With patient monitoring becoming crucial, AI finds numerous applications in chronic conditions, intensive care units, operating rooms, emergency rooms, and cardiac wards where timeless clinical decision-making can be measured in seconds. More advances have started to gain traction like smart prosthetics and implants. These play an impeccable role in patient management post-surgery or rehabilitation. Demographics, laboratory results and vital signs can also be used to predict cardiac arrest, transfer into the intensive care unit, or even death. In addition, an interpretable machine-learning model can assist anesthesiologists in predicting hypoxaemia events during surgery. This suggests that with deep-learning algorithms, raw patient-monitoring data could be better used to avoid information overload and alert overload while enabling more accurate clinical prediction and timely decision-making.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3-1024x578.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3279\" width=\"498\" height=\"282\" srcset=\"https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3-1024x578.jpg 1024w, https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3-768x434.jpg 768w, https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3-696x393.jpg 696w, https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3-1068x603.jpg 1068w, https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3-744x420.jpg 744w, https://insights.blackcoffer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\" /></figure></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Conclusion</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Considering the vast range of tasks that an AI can do, it is evident that it holds deep potential in improving patient outcomes to skyrocketing levels. Using sophisticated algorithms AI can bring a revolution in the healthcare sector. Even after facing challenges like whether the technology will be able to deliver the promises, ethical measures, training physicians to use it, standard regulations etc, the role of AI in transforming the clinical practices cannot be ignored. The biggest challenge is the integration of AI in daily practice. All of these can be overcome and within that period the technologies will mature making the system far more enhanced and effective.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">Blackcoffer

              "<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>“If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it will be a highly infectious virus rather than a war. Not missiles but microbes.” Bill Gates’s remarks at a TED conference in 2014, right after the world had avoided the Ebola outbreak. When the new, unprecedented, invisible virus hit us, it met an overwhelmed and unprepared healthcare system and oblivious population. This public health emergency demonstrated our lack of scientific consideration and underlined the alarming need for robust innovations in our health and medical facilities. For the past few years, artificial intelligence has proven to be of tangible potential in the healthcare sectors, clinical practices, translational medical and biomedical research.</p>\n",
              "<p>After the first case was detected in China on December 31st 2019, it was an AI program developed by BlueDot that alerted the world about the pandemic. It was quick to realise AI’s ability to analyse large chunks of data could help in detecting patterns and identifying and tracking the possible carriers of the virus.</p>\n",
              "<p>Many tracing apps use AI to keep tabs on the people who have been infected and prevent the risk of cross-infection by using AI algorithms that can track patterns and extract some features to classify or categorise them.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>So how does AI do that?</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>IBM Watson, a sophisticated AI that works on cloud computing and natural language processing, has prominently contributed to the healthcare sector on a global level. Being a conversational AI, since 2013, Watson has helped in recommending treatments to patients suffering from cancer to ensure that they get the best treatment at optimum costs.</p>\n",

              "<p>Researchers at Google Inc. showed that an AI system can be trained on thousands of images to achieve physician-level sensitivity.</p>\n",
              "<p>By identifying the molecular patterns associated with disease status and its subtypes, gene expression, and protein abundance levels, machine learning methods can detect fatal diseases like cancer at an early stage. Machine Learning (ML) techniques focus mainly on analyzing structured data, which can further help in clustering patients’ traits and infer the probability of disease outcomes. Since patient traits mainly include masses of data relating to age, gender, disease history, disease-specific data like diagnostic imaging and gene expressions, etc, ML can extract features from these data inputs by constructing data analytical algorithms.</p>\n",
              "<p>ML algorithms are either supervised or unsupervised. Unsupervised learning helps in extracting features and clustering similar features together that further leads to early detection of diseases. Clustering and principal component analysis enable grouping or clustering of similar traits together that are further used to maximize or minimize the similarity between the patients within or between the clusters. Since patient traits are recorded in multiple dimensions, such as genes, principal component analysis(PCA) creates the apparatus to reduce these dimensions which humans could have not done alone.</p>\n",
              "<p>Supervised learning considers the outcomes of the subjects together with the traits, and further correlates the inputs with the outputs to predict the probability of getting a particular clinical event, expected value of a disease level or expected survival time, or risk of Down’s syndrome.</p>\n",
              "<p>Biomarker panels that are mostly used to detect ovarian cancer, have outperformed the conventional statistical methods due to machine learning. In addition to this, the use of EHRs and Bayesian networks, which are a part of supervised machine learning algorithms, can predict clinical outcomes and mortality respectively.</p>\n",
              "<p>Unstructured data such as clinical notes and texts are converted into machine-readable structured data with the help of natural language processing(NLP). NLP works with two components: text processing and classification. Text processing helps in identifying a series of disease-relevant keywords in clinical notes and then through classification are further categorized into normal and abnormal cases. Chest screening through ML and NLP has helped find abnormalities in the lungs and provide treatment to covid patients. Healthcare organizations use NLP-based chatbots to increase interactions with patients, keeping their mental health and wellness in check.</p>\n",
              "<p>Deep learning is a modern extension of the classical neural network techniques which helps explore more complex non-linear patterns in data, using algorithms like convolution neural network, recurrent neural network, deep belief network, and deep neural network which enables more accurate clinical prediction. When it comes to genome interpretation, deep neural networks surpass the conventional methods of logistics regression and support vector machines.</p>\n",
              "<p>Sepsis Watch is an AI system trained in deep learning algorithms that holds the capability to analyze over 32 million data points to create a patient’s risk score and identify the early stages of sepsis.</p>\n",
              "<p>Another method known as the Learning-based Optimization of the Under Sampling Pattern( LOUPE) is based on integrating full resolution MRI scans with the convolutional neural network algorithm, which helps in creating more accurate reconstructions.</p>\n",
              "<p>Robotic surgery is widely considered in most delicate surgeries like gynaecology and prostate surgery. Even after striking the right balance between human decisions and AI precision, robotic surgery reduces surgeon efficiency as they have to be manually operated through a console. Thus, autonomous robotic surgery is on the rise with inventions such as robotic silicon fingers that mimic the sense of touch that surgeons need to identify organs, cut tissues, etc., or robotic catheters that can navigate whether it is touching blood, tissue, or valve.</p>\n",
              "<p>Researchers at Children’s National Hospital, Washington have already developed an AI called Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR), which performs a colon anastomosis on its own with the help of an ML-powered suturing tool, that automatically detects the patient’s breathing pattern to apply suture at the correct point.</p>\n",

              "<p>Cloud computing in healthcare has helped in retrieving and sharing medical records safely with a reduction in maintenance costs. Through this technology doctors and various healthcare workers have access to detailed patient data that helps in speeding up analysis ultimately leading to better care in the form of more accurate information, medications, and therapies.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>How can It help in Biomedical research?</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>Since AI can analyze literature beyond readability, it can be used to concise biomedical research. With the help of ML algorithms and NLP, AI can accelerate screening and indexing of biomedical research, by ranking the literature of interest which allows researchers to formulate and test scientific hypotheses far more precisely and quickly. Taking it to the next level, AI systems like the computational modelling assistant (CMA) helps researchers to construct simulation models from the concepts they have in mind. Such innovations have majorly contributed to topics such as tumour suppressor mechanisms and protein-protein interaction information extraction.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>AI as precision medicine</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>Since precision medicine focuses on healthcare interventions to individuals or groups of patients based on their profile, the various AI devices pave the way to practice it more efficiently. With the help of ML, complex algorithms like large datasets can be used to predict and create an optimal treatment strategy.</p>\n",
              "<p>Deep learning and neural networks can be used to process data in healthcare apps and keep a close watch on the patient’s emotional state, food intake, or health monitoring. </p>\n",
              "<p>“Omics” refers to the collective technologies that help in exploring the roles, relationships of various branches ending with the suffix “omics” such as genomics, proteomics, etc. Omics-based tests based on machine learning algorithms help find correlations and predict treatment responses, ultimately creating personalized treatments for individual patients. </p>\n",
              "<p><strong>How it helps in psychology and neuro patients</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>For psychologists studying creativity,  AI is promising new classes of experiments that are developing data structures and programs and exploring novel theories on a new horizon. Studies show that  AI can conduct therapy sessions, <a href=\"https://positivepsychology.com/e-therapy/\">e-therapy</a> sessions, and assessments autonomously, also assisting human practitioners before, during, or after sessions. The Detection and Computational Analysis of Psychological Signal project uses ML, computer vision, and NLP to analyze language, physical gestures, and social signals to identify cues for human distress. This ground-breaking technology assesses soldiers returning from combat and recognizes those who require further mental health support. In the future, it will combine data captured during face-to-face interviews with information on sleeping, eating, and online behaviours for a complete patient view.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>Stroke identification</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>Stroke is another frequently occurring disease that affects more than 500 million people worldwide. Thrombus,  in the vessel cerebral infarction is the major (about 85%) cause of stroke occurrence. In recent years, AI techniques have been used in numerous stroke-related studies as early detection and timely treatment along with efficient outcome prediction can help solve the problem. With AI at our disposal, large amounts of data with rich information, more complications and real-life clinical questions can be addressed in this arena. Currently, two ML algorithms- genetic fuzzy finite state machine and PCA were implemented to build a model building solution. These include a human activity recognition stage and a stroke onset detection stage. An alert stroke message is activated as soon as a movement significantly different from the normal pattern is recorded. ML methods have been applied to neuroimaging data to assist disease evaluation and predicting stroke treatment for the diagnosis.</p>\n",
              "<p><strong>Patient Monitoring</strong></p>\n",
              "<p>Today, the market for AI-based patient monitoring is impressive and monetarily enticing. It is evolving with artificial sensors, smart technologies and explores everything from brain-computer interfaces to nanorobotics. Companies with their smart-watches have engaged people to perform remote monitoring even when they are not “patients”. An obvious place to start is with wearable and embedded sensors, glucose monitors, pulse monitors, oximeters, and ECG monitors. With patient monitoring becoming crucial, AI finds numerous applications in chronic conditions, intensive care units, operating rooms, emergency rooms, and cardiac wards where timeless clinical decision-making can be measured in seconds. More advances have started to gain traction like smart prosthetics and implants. These play an impeccable role in patient management post-surgery or rehabilitation. Demographics, laboratory results and vital signs can also be used to predict cardiac arrest, transfer into the intensive care unit, or even death. In addition, an interpretable machine-learning model can assist anesthesiologists in predicting hypoxaemia events during surgery. This suggests that with deep-learning algorithms, raw patient-monitoring data could be better used to avoid information overload and alert overload while enabling more accurate clinical prediction and timely decision-making.</p>\n",

              "<p>Considering the vast range of tasks that an AI can do, it is evident that it holds deep potential in improving patient outcomes to skyrocketing levels. Using sophisticated algorithms AI can bring a revolution in the healthcare sector. Even after facing challenges like whether the technology will be able to deliver the promises, ethical measures, training physicians to use it, standard regulations etc, the role of AI in transforming the clinical practices cannot be ignored. The biggest challenge is the integration of AI in daily practice. All of these can be overcome and within that period the technologies will mature making the system far more enhanced and effective.</p>\n",

a ted conference in 2014 right after the world had avoided the ebola outbreak when the new unprecedented invisible virus hit us it met an overwhelmed and unprepared healthcare system and oblivious population this public health emergency demonstrated our lack of scientific consideration and underlined the alarming need for robust innovations in our health and medical facilities for the past few years artificial intelligence has proven to be of tangible potential in the healthcare sectors clinical practices translational medical and biomedical researchafter the first case was detected in china on december 31st 2019 it was an ai program developed by bluedot that alerted the world about the pandemic it was quick to realise ai’s ability to analyse large chunks of data could help in detecting patterns and identifying and tracking the possible carriers of the virusmany tracing apps use ai to keep tabs on the people who have been infected and prevent the risk of cross-infection by using ai algorithms that can track patterns and extract some features to classify or categorise themso how does ai do thatibm watson a sophisticated ai that works on cloud computing and natural language processing has prominently contributed to the healthcare sector on a global level being a conversational ai since 2013 watson has helped in recommending treatments to patients suffering from cancer to ensure that they get the best treatment at optimum costsresearchers at google inc showed that an ai system can be trained on thousands of images to achieve physician-level sensitivityby identifying the molecular patterns associated with disease status and its subtypes gene expression and protein abundance levels machine learning methods can detect fatal diseases like cancer at an early stage machine learning (ml) techniques focus mainly on analyzing structured data which can further help in clustering patients’ traits and infer the probability of disease outcomes since patient traits mainly include masses of data relating to age gender disease history disease-specific data like diagnostic imaging and gene expressions etc ml can extract features from these data inputs by constructing data analytical algorithmsml algorithms are either supervised or unsupervised unsupervised learning helps in extracting features and clustering similar features together that further leads to early detection of diseases clustering and principal component analysis enable grouping or clustering of similar traits together that are further used to maximize or minimize the similarity between the patients within or between the clusters since patient traits are recorded in multiple dimensions such as genes principal component analysis(pca) creates the apparatus to reduce these dimensions which humans could have not done alonesupervised learning considers the outcomes of the subjects together with the traits and further correlates the inputs with the outputs to predict the probability of getting a particular clinical event expected value of a disease level or expected survival time or risk of down’s syndromebiomarker panels that are mostly used to detect ovarian cancer have outperformed the conventional statistical methods due to machine learning in addition to this the use of ehrs and bayesian networks which are a part of supervised machine learning algorithms can predict clinical outcomes and mortality respectivelyunstructured data such as clinical notes and texts are converted into machine-readable structured data with the help of natural language processing(nlp) nlp works with two components: text processing and classification text processing helps in identifying a series of disease-relevant keywords in clinical notes and then through classification are further categorized into normal and abnormal cases chest screening through ml and nlp has helped find abnormalities in the lungs and provide treatment to covid patients healthcare organizations use nlp-based chatbots to increase interactions with patients keeping their mental health and wellness in checkdeep learning is a modern extension of the classical neural network techniques which helps explore more complex non-linear patterns in data using algorithms like convolution neural network recurrent neural network deep belief network and deep neural network which enables more accurate clinical prediction when it comes to genome interpretation deep neural networks surpass the conventional methods of logistics regression and support vector machinessepsis watch is an ai system trained in deep learning algorithms that holds the capability to analyze over 32 million data points to create a patient’s risk score and identify the early stages of sepsisanother method known as the learning-based optimization of the under sampling pattern( loupe) is based on integrating full resolution mri scans with the convolutional neural network algorithm which helps in creating more accurate reconstructionsrobotic surgery is widely considered in most delicate surgeries like gynaecology and prostate surgery even after striking the right balance between human decisions and ai precision robotic surgery reduces surgeon efficiency as they have to be manually operated through a console thus autonomous robotic surgery is on the rise with inventions such as robotic silicon fingers that mimic the sense of touch that surgeons need to identify organs cut tissues etc or robotic catheters that can navigate whether it is touching blood tissue or valveresearchers at children’s national hospital washington have already developed an ai called smart tissue autonomous robot (star) which performs a colon anastomosis on its own with the help of an ml-powered suturing tool that automatically detects the patient’s breathing pattern to apply suture at the correct pointan image of star during surgerycloud computing in healthcare has helped in retrieving and sharing medical records safely with a reduction in maintenance costs through this technology doctors and various healthcare workers have access to detailed patient data that helps in speeding up analysis ultimately leading to better care in the form of more accurate information medications and therapieshow can it help in biomedical researchsince ai can analyze literature beyond readability it can be used to concise biomedical research with the help of ml algorithms and nlp ai can accelerate screening and indexing of biomedical research by ranking the literature of interest which allows researchers to formulate and test scientific hypotheses far more precisely and quickly taking it to the next level ai systems like the computational modelling assistant (cma) helps researchers to construct simulation models from the concepts they have in mind such innovations have majorly contributed to topics such as tumour suppressor mechanisms and protein-protein interaction information extractionai as precision medicinesince precision medicine focuses on healthcare interventions to individuals or groups of patients based on their profile the various ai devices pave the way to practice it more efficiently with the help of ml complex algorithms like large datasets can be used to predict and create an optimal treatment strategydeep learning and neural networks can be used to process data in healthcare apps and keep a close watch on the patient’s emotional state food intake or health monitoring\\xa0“omics” refers to the collective technologies that help in exploring the roles relationships of various branches ending with the suffix “omics” such as genomics proteomics etc omics-based tests based on machine learning algorithms help find correlations and predict treatment responses ultimately creating personalized treatments for individual patients\\xa0how it helps in psychology and neuro patientsfor psychologists studying creativity\\xa0 ai is promising new classes of experiments that are developing data structures and programs and exploring novel theories on a new horizon studies show that \\xa0ai can conduct therapy sessions e-therapy sessions and assessments autonomously also assisting human practitioners before during or after sessions the detection and computational analysis of psychological signal project uses ml computer vision and nlp to analyze language physical gestures and social signals to identify cues for human distress this ground-breaking technology assesses soldiers returning from combat and recognizes those who require further mental health support in the future it will combine data captured during face-to-face interviews with information on sleeping eating and online behaviours for a complete patient viewstroke identificationstroke is another frequently occurring disease that affects more than 500 million people worldwide thrombus\\xa0 in the vessel cerebral infarction is the major (about 85%) cause of stroke occurrence in recent years ai techniques have been used in numerous stroke-related studies as early detection and timely treatment along with efficient outcome prediction can help solve the problem with ai at our disposal large amounts of data with rich information more complications and real-life clinical questions can be addressed in this arena currently two ml algorithms- genetic fuzzy finite state machine and pca were implemented to build a model building solution these include a human activity recognition stage and a stroke onset detection stage an alert stroke message is activated as soon as a movement significantly different from the normal pattern is recorded ml methods have been applied to neuroimaging data to assist disease evaluation and predicting stroke treatment for the diagnosispatient monitoringtoday the market for ai-based patient monitoring is impressive and monetarily enticing it is evolving with artificial sensors smart technologies and explores everything from brain-computer interfaces to nanorobotics companies with their smart-watches have engaged people to perform remote monitoring even when they are not “patients” an obvious place to start is with wearable and embedded sensors glucose monitors pulse monitors oximeters and ecg monitors with patient monitoring becoming crucial ai finds numerous applications in chronic conditions intensive care units operating rooms emergency rooms and cardiac wards where timeless clinical decision-making can be measured in seconds more advances have started to gain traction like smart prosthetics and implants these play an impeccable role in patient management post-surgery or rehabilitation demographics laboratory results and vital signs can also be used to predict cardiac arrest transfer into the intensive care unit or even death in addition an interpretable machine-learning model can assist anesthesiologists in predicting hypoxaemia events during surgery this suggests that with deep-learning algorithms raw patient-monitoring data could be better used to avoid information overload and alert overload while enabling more accurate clinical prediction and timely decision-making\\xa0conclusionconsidering the vast range of tasks that an ai can do it is evident that it holds deep potential in improving patient outcomes to skyrocketing levels using sophisticated algorithms ai can bring a revolution in the healthcare sector even after facing challenges like whether the technology will be able to deliver the promises ethical measures training physicians to use it standard regulations etc the role of ai in transforming the clinical practices cannot be ignored the biggest challenge is the integration of ai in daily practice all of these can be overcome and

              " 'human minds a fascination in itself carrying the potential of tinkering nature with the pixie dust intelligence creating and solving the mysteries and wonders with anything but admiration however no matter how captivating a human mind can be it could sometimes be appalled it could be the hunger or maybe the desire to want more to go beyond and unravel the limitations or maybe something like pure greed humans have never stopped and always keep evolving when it comes to intelligence and this is what makes them the supremeintelligence calls out for supremacy and so what if there was to evolve something that opposed a challenge to the very human minds to their capabilities while making them question their own importance among themselves artificial intelligence came as a revolution havoc when it first came to the light the concept of making machines does work on their own like granting machines –the intelligencethe idea of making machines work like humans came back in the 19s back then people didn’t believe in such a thing as making a non-living thing work think and carry tasks on its own not to mention to actually surpass humans themselves in those skills the facts are it did by 1997 the greatest chess player garry kasparov was defeated in a chess game by a machine and this is where exactly a top skilled human lost to a mere machine created by another who by himself could’ve never defeated him it was a rule of power of betterment of skills and the granted supremacy were ai and machines just tools equipment\\xa0 something that helped an unskilled person with his mind and intelligence creates something that could do the skilled work for him with perfection and precision well initially it was however as time passed as humans got drawn to the puzzle of ai a lot changed human research went deeper and deeper and as a result the machines evolved with itat present ai & machines is a growing field as it develops and improves it has become a part of the industrial revolution in industries most of the laborious work that was once taken care of by humans was now replaced by machines naturally with the evolution in machines its precision mass productivity quality control time efficiencies and all the other factors made it a better choice a choice over humansthis led to fear a fear of a not-so-distant future a future where maybe machines will be so evolved that they’ll take over the need of a human employee leading to unemployment with the population increase around the world it became the new tech threat for the labor market then again… how true is it does ai really oppose a threat will adapting to technology make millions of people lose their jobs will it lead to mass unemployment will the machines really surpass humans will the creation take over the creatorno matter how fearful the future with ai may seem in reality it is not that scary truth is ai is the present reality it is the key that holds the power to unlock a whole next level of human evolution technology is growing there was a time where technology was just an idea but today that idea has been implemented it’s working and is carried out nobody could stop the advancement and growth of artificial intelligence it’s a wave that is already flowing and we as the present generation and the generations to come to have to learn to learn to swim in this flow and avoid drowningmany jobs will be replaced by machines as ai evolves it’ll keep challenging human minds and their skills with the present covid 19 situation contactless cashiers to robots delivering packages have already taken over the usual routine tasks the jobs of secretaries schedulers and book-keeper are at risk too manufacturing units agriculture food services retail transportation & logistic and hospitality are all a part of the ai-affected automation at an estimation it is said that around 20 million jobs especially including manufacturing will be lost to robots as ai robotics 3d printing and genetics make their way in even the architects medical docs and music composers feel threatened by technology making us question that will ai even edge us out of our brain jobs too now that can be terrifyinghowever as much as machines will be replacing few jobs they’ll also be creating new jobs\\xa0 with the economic growth innovation and investment around 133 million jobs are said to be generated these newly enhanced jobs are to create benefits and amplify one’s creativity strategy and entrepreneurial skills so what is the catchwell it’s the skills even though ai is creating 3 times more jobs than it is destroying it’s the skills that count ai surged in new job opportunities opportunities like senior data scientist mobile application developer and seo specialist these jobs were once never heard of but now with ai it’s born however to do these jobs or for its qualification one needs high-level skills and to acquire those skills can be an expensive and time-consuming task the future generation might be able to cope up with it but the real struggle is to be faced by the present two generations it’s the vulnerability between the skill gap and unemployment and the youths are the ones to be crushed the mosttherefore as the advancement of ai becomes inevitable there remains no choice but to adapt learn equip ourselves and grow with it the companies have to work together to build an ai-ready workplace they should collaborate with the government educators and non-profit organizations and work together to bring out policies that could help understand the technologies’ impacts faster while also providing the employees some security the economic and business planning should be made considerable for minimizing the impact on local jobs and properly maximizing the opportunitiesthe employees should be provided with proper tools to carry along with the new opportunities while acquiring ai-based skills for their day-to-day work new skills should be identified and implemented for the upskilling and continual learning initiatives employees will have to maximize their robotic quotient and learn core skills they’ll have to adapt to new working models and understand their roles in the coming future\\xa0howsoever it’s not like ai will totally take over control even though ai proves to be a better choice it still has its limitations at present first it’s expensive secondly manufacturing machines in bulk is not good for the environment machines are also very high maintenance therefore human labor will often come cheaper and so will be considered over machines underdeveloped countries will find it hard to equip their people with the upskilling and reskilling required for ai workplace and so for ai to play a role in those countries might take years ai can also be risky and unethical as it’s hard to figure out who to be held responsible for in cases where an ai went wrongno matter how advanced ai gets there are some skills where humans will always have an upper hand ie soft skills skills like teamwork communication creativity and critical thinking are something that ai hasn’t been able to beat us up to yet and so the value of creativity leadership and emotional intelligence has increased although with machines coming in between humans causing the lack of human-to-human interaction the humans seem to fade away a littlewith this era comes the need for good leaders leaders who are capable of handling both machines and humans together the ones who are organized enough to manage the skilled and the unskilled employees while providing the unskilled trainees with proper training leaders who hold profound soft skills and encourage teamwork while working along with machines the ones who are patient calm and optimized \\xa0in conclusion yes ai and machines are going to be very challenging but there’s nothing humans haven’t overcome adaptation and up-gradation are going to be the primary factor for survival as we witness the onset of the 4th industrial revolution let’s buckle up our seats and race along the highway with the essential fuels (skills) so as to not let ourselves eliminated after all this is an unending race with infinity as the end all we could do is try not to run out of fuel try not to be outdated\\xa0blackcoffer insights 29: glady karunya institute of technology and sciences',\n",

particularly at the graduate level due to their high employability however the evolution of machinery in industries is changing that according to research 230000 jobs in these sectors may be replaced by ai agents in the next 5 years this is due to the nature of the work as employees are responsible for tasks such as data analysis and keeping track of numerical information; which machines excel at large complicated data sets can be analyzed faster and more efficiently by ai-powered computers than by people algorithmic trading procedures that produce automated deals are less likely to be produced without minute errors when undertaken by humans in such matters involving industrial work a subsection of artificial intelligence is used; namely machine learningmachine learning is a term used for the application of artificial intelligence (ai) in systems which involves them assimilating and processing information by gaining experience it is mainly concerned with the development of technology and computer programs\\xa0its improvement process is mainly divided into seven steps; which start with the collection of data this data can be collected from an internal database or perhaps an iot structure the second and most time-consuming step is cleaning preparing and rearranging the data; which involves the recognition of outliers trends and missing information so that the outcome is as accurate as possible the third step consists of formatting data; which is useful if you source your information from a variety of sources step four is where ai comes into place self-service data processing tools may be useful if they provide intelligent services for matching data attributes from distinct databases and intelligently integrating them the data is then arranged to better represent a specific pattern lastly the data is divided into two sets: one for training the algorithm and one for analysisthere are three types of machine learning; supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning the most common of the bunch is supervised machine learning; which is based on accurately labeled data the machine is given a collection of information including the outcome of the operation the rest of the information is referred to as ‘input features’ which ‘supervises’ the machine by guiding it to establish the connections between the variantsin the case of unsupervised learning the machine isn’t given labeled sets of data to be divided into allowing it to recognize and create its own patterns within the information provided since computers have the capabilities of identifying distinguished similarities this method helps with the classifying of such datareinforcement learning comprises experience-based learning similar to people they learn due to a reward and punishment system based on their actionsthese variations of system learning have recently been integrated into business and finance which is elaborated on in the following passagesmachine learning in finance and bankingthere are many ways in which machine learning is used in finance and banking the most common place it is used is to detect any frauds fraud is the most common problem in financial service companies and it accounts for billions of dollars in misfortune each year the most common frauds are credit or debit card usage by a stranger document forgery and mortgage fraudusually finance companies keep an enormous amount of their data stored online and it increases the risk of information being accessed without authorization with expanding innovative headway misrepresentation in the monetary business is currently viewed as a high danger to significant information fraud recognition frameworks in the past were planned dependent on a bunch of rules which could be effortlessly be bypassed by current fraudsters therefore most companies today leverage machine learning to combat fraudulent financial transactions\\xa0machine learning works by looking over enormous informational indexes to distinguish unique or suspicious activities for additional examination by security groups it works by looking at an exchange against other information focuses – like the client’s record history ip address area and so forth\\xa0 depending on the type of exchange taking place the program can automatically refuse a withdrawal or purchase until the person makes a decisionexamples of fraud detection software used by banks include feedzai data visor and teradatamachine learning is also used in algorithmic trading portfolio management loan underwriting chatbots and improving customer servicealgorithmic trading is an interaction for executing orders using computerized and pre-modified exchanging guidelines to represent factors like value timing and volume an algorithm is a set of directions for solving a problem computer calculations send little parts of the full request to the market over the long runin contrast to human dealers algorithmic exchanging can investigate enormous volumes of information every day and therefore make thousands of trades every day machine learning settles on quick exchanging choices which gives human traders a benefit over the market normal likewise algorithmic exchanging doesn’t settle on exchanging choices dependent on feelings which is a typical constraint among human dealers whose judgment might be influenced by feelings or individual desires the exchanging technique is generally utilized by multifaceted investment administrators and monetary foundations to automate trading activitiesin the banking industry organizations access a large number of shopper information with which machine learning can be prepared to work in order to simplify the underwriting process machine learning calculations can settle on speedy choices on endorsing and credit scoring and save organizations both time and monetary assets that are utilized by peopledata scientists can train algorithms on how to analyze millions of consumer data to coordinate with information records search for interesting special cases and settle on a choice on whether a shopper meets all requirements for an advance or protection for instance the calculation can be prepared on the most proficient method to examine shopper information like age pay occupation and the buyer’s credit conductthe benefits of machine learningas with any form of revolutionary technology the usage of machine learning has been debated over as its beneficial properties have been weighed against the possible disadvantages it’s been observed that upon correct usage it may be used to solve a wide range of business challenges and anticipate complicated customer behavior we’ve also seen several of the largest it conglomerates such as google amazon and microsoft introduce cloud machine learning platformstechnology vs human intelligencein terms of business ml can aid businesses by identifying consumer’s demands and formulate a pattern based on them; allowing companies to reach out to such consumers and maximize their sales it eliminates the need for expenses on some maintenance by reducing the risks associated with unexpected breakdowns and minimizes wasteful costs to the firms\\xa0 historical data a process visualization tool a flexible analytical environment and a feedback loop may all be used to build an ml architecture the input of data is another agitating chore for businesses in the present which is where machine learning can step in for manual labor this eradicates the possibility of errors caused by manual labor causing disruptions and provides employees with extra time to handle other tasksin the financial sector machine learning is already utilized for portfolio management algorithmic trading loan underwriting and fraud detection chatbots and other conversational interfaces for security customer support and sentiment analysis will be among the future uses of ml in banking another aspect of business involving artificial intelligence includes image recognition which entails a system or program that recognizes objects people places and movements in photos it identifies photographs using an imaging system and machine recognition tech with artificial intelligence and programmed algorithmsthe downfalls of machine learningwith all the benefits of its advancement machine learning isn’t the most perfect thing there are several disadvantages which are information acquisition time and resources and high errors and wrong interpretations one of the major hurdles is the amount of finance needed to invest in machine learning for it to be a successful project more issues have to do with the fact that ai requires gigantic informational indexes to train on and these ought to be unbiased and of good quality there can likewise be times where they have to wait for that new information to be produced machine learning needs sufficient opportunity to do the calculations to learn and adequately to satisfy their accuracy and relevancy it also needs huge resources to work this can mean extra requirements for the computer to work another significant problem is the capacity to precisely decipher the results produced by the calculations you should likewise cautiously pick the algorithms to get the wanted resultsconclusionthere have been various reports in the past and current years which claim that a significant piece of the human labor force will be replaced via robots and machines in the years to come with excessive innovative work being led in the field of computerized reasoning many dread that a significant job crisis will unfurl since numerous positions are all the more precisely and productively performed with the use of machines in countries like japan mainly computer programs and ai is used in the secondary and tertiary sectors from cleaning the house to depositing money in banks everything is done by ai however ai cannot replace humans in the future humans have several capabilities which even after several technological advancements a machine would not be able to have these capabilities include creative thinking and creative problem solving and human connection for example when a child goes to a doctor to get an injection a nurse always relaxes the child to not be afraid of the needle a machine’s touch would not be able to soothe a child another example could be how humans tend to share things with each other and be open about it a machine will not be able to do so since it is only programmed to things it has been told to do like computers ai will not replace us but would however complement us to make daily work easier and less time-consuming without humans themselves there is no future for aiblackcoffer insights 29: amara arora and vaanya kaushal scottish high international school',\n",

are increasingly part of our daily lives just look around the grocery store or the highway they are everywhere this makes us wonder what if ai can replace human intelligence what can we do to make ourselves relevant tomorrow let us try to find the answers to all these questions and morelet’s first understand what is artificial intelligence –artificial intelligence or ai basically machines displaying intelligence this can be seen from a machine playing chess or a robot answering questions on facebook artificial intelligence can be further broken down into many different types there are ais designed to do specific tasks such as detecting a specific type of cancer however there are also ais that can do multiple tasks such as driving a car there are many types of ais among the top most important fields are machine learning or ml neural network computer vision and natural language processing or nlpmachine learning is the idea of machines being able to prove themselves similar to how a human being learns a new skill machine learning also allows for the optimization of an existing skill machine learning is used in many different fields and one such application is entertainment netflix uses machine learning to recommend more shows that you can watch based on the shows that you have already seenneural networks are algorithms that are modeled after the human brain these algorithms think just like we do which can thereby give similar results to what a human being can give artificial neural networks are used in medical fields to diagnose cancers like lung cancer and prostate cancercomputer vision is the idea that computers have visions this allows them to see things the way human beings do or potentially better than human beings do depending on the programming camera used etc computer vision is used in autonomous vehicles for navigation from one place to anothernatural language processing is the idea that computers can listen to what we say an example of this is siri siri is able to listen to our demands process what it means and provide you an answer based on what is researchednow that we know what an ai is and what it can do let’s talk about the

jobs thereby replacing what humans already do this means more job loss and the concentration of wealth to the selected few people this could mean a destabilization of society and social unrest in addition to social unrest ai improves over time this means it becomes smarter faster and cheaper to implement and it will be better at doing repetitive things that humans currently do such as preparing fast food it is predicted that ai will improve so much over 50 to 100 years that ai will become super intelligent this means that it will become even smarter than the most intelligent human on earth according to many experts such as elon musk this could cause the end of human civilization ai could potentially start a war against humans burn crops and do all sorts of tragedies once reserved for human functions at that point in theory we can not stop it because ai would have already thought of all the obstacles that will prevent its goal this means that we cannot unplug the machine in effect ai will replace human intelligencebut will this happen in next 10 to 30 yearsno the field of artificial intelligence is sophisticated enough to do many human tasks that humans currently do currently ai is not smart enough to be empathetic to humans and cannot think strategically enough to solve complex problems ai solutions can be expensive and have to go through many different tests and standards to implement it also takes time for ai to improve for example boston dynamics one of the world’s top robotics company had a robot in 2009 that needed assistance to walk fast forward to 2019 not only the robot could walk by itself but it could jump over objects do backflips and so much more in addition to the timing it takes time for the price of any new technological solution to drop to a point where it is affordable for example a desktop computer costs around $1000 in 1999 but now you can get a significantly more powerful laptop for the exact same price ai will go through the same curvebut what happens after those 10 to 30 years will ai make human intelligence obsolete maybe as we have proven earlier ai will become faster better and cheaper as this happens more and more companies will use ai technology to automate more and more jobs to save money increase productivity and most importantly stay competitive as we have demonstrated ai will become better through repetition via the use of machine learning the only difference is that ai will be able to learn faster as time progresses due to the amount of data that is available today it will also be able to learn from other machines or similar machines to learn how to optimize its tasks or new important skills however ai also just not do repetitive and routine tasks better it will also be able to understand emotional intelligence ethics and creativity this seen in three distinct example- ibmibm uses its ibm watson to program the ai to create a movie trailer fox approached ibm and said they

trailer created by machines example – googlein 2018 google demonstrated an ai assistance that could take calls and do simple stuff the ai was able to set up an appointment what was more fascinating was that it was able to understand the nuances of the conversation the receptionist thought it was a human being that was calling her that is a very primitive version of what is possible with this technology eventually it will be able to have conversations just as human beings do making many sales jobs obsolete example – ai generated artin 2018 a paris art collective consisting of three students used artificial intelligence to generate a portrait it generated the portrait painting by studying a set of fifteen thousand art images on wiki art it was estimated to be worth between seven thousand to ten thousand dollars the painting sold at an auction for four thirty-five thousand us dollarshowever we cannot for sure say that ai will replace human intelligence this is because we as a society have started asking hard questions and questioning ethics elon musk founded open ai a research lab whose whole purpose is to promote and discover artificial intelligence in a way to benefits humanity in addition to this there are many factors that affect the long-term outcome of ai replacing human intelligence like to what degree will other humans allow for ai to take over depending on

              " '“machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make”nick bostromto put it frankly artificial intelligence will eventually replace jobs workers in a variety of industries from healthcare to agriculture and manufacturing should expect to witness hiring disruptions as a result of artificial intelligenceif history has taught us anything it is that disruptive paradigm-shifting business ideas not only make a fortune for the innovators but they also build the groundwork for new business models market entrants and job opportunities which will inevitably follow it is true that robots today or in future will eventually replace humans for many jobs but so did innovative farming equipment for humans and horses during the industrial revolution but that does not mean that our jobs as humans will end here we on the other hand will be required to generate and provide value in whole new ways for entirely new business models as a result of these changesaccording to 71% of the businesses worldwide artificial intelligence can help people overcome critical and challenging problems and live better lives artificial intelligence consultants at work will be more or equally fair according to a whopping 83% of corporate leaders these results demonstrate that artificial intelligence is steadily extending its measures yielding societal benefits and allowing citizens to live more fulfilling livesincrease in automation and jobs where humans can’t competesince the advent of industry 40 businesses are moving at a fast pace towards automation be it any type of industry in 2013 researchers at oxford university did a study on the future of work they concluded that almost one in every two jobs have a high risk of being automated by machines machine learning is responsible for this disruption it is the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence it allows machines to learn from data and mimic some of the things that humans can doa research was conducted by the employees of kaggle wherein an algorithm was to be created to take images of a human eye and diagnose an eye disease known as diabetic retinopathy here the winning algorithm could match the diagnosis given by human ophthalmologists another study was conducted wherein an algorithm should be created to grade high school essays here too the winning algorithm could match the grade given by human teachersthus we can safely conclude that given the right data machines can easily outperform human beings in tasks like these a teacher might read 10000 essays over a 40-year career; an ophthalmologist might see 50000 eyes but a machine can read a million essays and see a million eyes within minutesthus it is convenient to conclude that we have no chance of competing with machines on frequent high volume tasks\\xa0tasks where machines don’t workbut there are tasks where human beings have an upper hand and that is in novel tasks machines can’t handle things they haven’t seen many times before the fundamental rule of machine learning is that it learns from large volumes of past data but humans don’t; we have the ability of seemingly connecting disparate threads to solve problems we haven’t seen before\\xa0percy spencer was a physicist working on radar during world war 2 where he noticed that the magnetron was melting his chocolate bar here he was able to connect his understanding of electromagnetic radiation with his knowledge of cooking in order to invent the microwave oven now this sort of cross pollination happens to each one of us several times in a day thus machines cannot compete with us when it comes to tackling novel situations\\xa0now as we all know that around 92% of talented professionals believe that soft skills such as human interactions and fostering relationships matter much more than hard skills in being successful in managing a workplace perhaps these are the kind of tasks that machines can never compete with humans at\\xa0also creative tasks: the copy behind a marketing campaign needs to grab customers’ attention and will have to stand out of the crowd business strategy means finding gaps in the market and accordingly working on them since machines cannot outperform humans in novel tasks it will be humans who would be creating these campaigns and strategies\\xa0human contact would be essential in care-giving and educational-related work responsibilities and technology would take a backseat health screenings and customer service face-to-face communication would advocate for human contact with artificial intelligence playing a supporting role\\xa0so what does this mean for the future of work the future state of any single job lies in the answer to one single question: to what extent is the job reducible to tackling frequent high-volume tasks and to what extent does it involve tackling novel situationstoday machines diagnose diseases and grade exam papers over the coming years they’re going to conduct audits they’re going to read boilerplate from legal contracts but does that mean we’re not going to be needing accountants and lawyers wrong we’re still going to need them for complex tax structuring for path breaking litigation it will only get tougher to get these jobs as machine learning will shrink their ranks\\xa0amazon has recruited more than 100000 robots in its warehouses to help move goods and products around more effectively and its warehouse workforce has expanded by more than 80000 people humans pick and pack goods (amazon has over 480000000 products on its “shelves”) while robots move orders throughout the enormous warehouses therefore reducing “the amount of walking required of workers making amazon pickers more efficient and less exhausted” furthermore because amazon no longer requires aisle space for humans the robots enable amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rush-hour traffic” more inventory under one roof offers better selection for customers and a higher density of shelf space equals more inventory under one roofkodak vs instagramkodak once an undisputed giant of the photography industry had a 90% share in the usa market in 1976 and by 1984 they were employing 145000 people but in the year 2012 they had a net worth of negative $1 billion and they had to declare bankruptcy why because they failed to predict the importance of exponential trends when it comes to technology on the other hand instagram a digital photography company started in 2012 with 13 employees and later they were sold to facebook for $1 billion this is so ironic because kodak pioneered digital photography and actually invented the first digital camera but unfortunately thought of it as a mere product and didn’t pay attention towards it and this created the problem\\xa0\\xa0we live in an era of artificial intelligence (ai) which has given us tremendous computing power storage space and information access we were given the spinning wheel in

industry’s fastest-growing segment of any size”the reduction in need for people as a result of artificial intelligence and related technologies which resulted in job layoffs was a cause of fear in india alone job losses in the it sector have reportedly reached 1000 in the last year owing to the integration of new and advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning\\xa0most of the it companies such as infosys wipro tcs and cognizant have reduced their employee base in india and are recruiting less while engaging more personnel in the united states and investing heavily in “centres of innovation” artificial intelligence and data science which are currently the trending aspects that require fewer people and are primarily located abroad aren’t helping the prospects of local employees another factor is that the computer industry is continuously growing and would develop to a size of two million workers unfortunately it’s a drop in the bucket

for efficiency this is a victory but a disaster for job prospects\\xa0concluding remarksinternal re-skilling and redeployment of staff is a critical requirement of the hour artificial intelligence has presented indian policymakers with epistemological scientific and ethical issues this requires us to abandon regular linear and non-disruptive mental patterns the tale of artificial intelligence’s influence on individuals and their occupations will only be told over time it is up to us to upskill ourselves and look for ways to stay current with the industry’s current trends and demands\\xa0so will machines be able to take over many of our jobs the answer is a resounding yes however for every job that is taken over by robots there will be an equal number of positions available for people to do some of these human vocations will be artistic in nature others will necessitate humans honing superhuman cognitive abilities humans and machines can form symbiotic relationships assisting each other in doing what they do best in the future people and machines may be able to collaborate and work together towards a common goal for any business they work for\\xa0blackcoffer insights 29:  syed

on i think it’s best to level set on what constitutes\\xa0machines\\xa0in the context of this article  machines describe computers and computerized equipment like robots that have been programmed to learn sometimes like humans occasionally we call this artificial intelligence (ai) other times we call this machine learning and still other times we call this robotics and yes these are technically different things these bots are more efficient than humans in some specific domains and are growing smarter with each passing day they can do some really tough tasks which are considered difficult for any human being \\xa0but within the broad discussion related to the future of work these are totally interrelated factory floors deploy robots that are increasingly driven by machine learning algorithms such that they can adjust to people working alongside them a machine can work efficiently only it has abundant data and information about the work which is being imparted daily to them but with every forward step & advancement in technology a threat is proliferating a threat of being replaced on our work front every passing day is sealing some jobs for humans all over the globe similarly ai is being used to turn hand-drawn sketches (done by humans) into digital source coderole of machines in companies and its future:companies are clearly developing their ai and robotics expertise with the idea that through these technological innovations they’ll be able tocut costsincrease efficienciesoffer new value propositionsexecute new business models or all of the aboveof course it’s not just machines and creatives working together either in another example amazon has employed more than 100000 robots in its warehouses to efficiently move things around while it has increased its warehouse workforce by more than 80000 humans in amazon’s case do the picking and packing of goods while robots move orders around the giant warehouses essentially cutting “down on the walking required of workers making amazon pickers more efficient and less tired” plus the robots “allow amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rush-hour traffic because they no longer need aisle space for humans the greater density of shelf space means more inventory under one roof which means better selection for customers”why machines can replace humansduring the next few decades (or maybe sooner) the notion of work and whether it is handled by a human or a virtual being will hinge on predictability as they are starting to do today machines will manage the routine while humans take on the unpredictable – tasks that require creativity problem-solving and flexibility in this context robotics should be seen not only as a means to improve operations efficiency but also to improve the quality of life for workersalthough it is obvious that human factors involved in a work activity impact job automation it is also true that highly repetitive tasks—and even mechanical ones—are ideal for robots besides greater efficiency and speed automation leads to a lower risk of accidents greater control and autonomy and above all fewer costs for organizationsare machines more diligent than humansalthough artificial intelligence and machine learning make us believe that robots are endowed with superior intelligence in fact they don’t yet have the ability to learn from experience and to respond to unknowns so as things stand however much processing speed and automatic learning a robot has it doesn’t beat factors innate to the human brain humans are still a very essential part of the process think about delivering services to a client most customer challenges are routine but humans play a very important role in addressing new issues solving them the first time they appear and then consolidating the process into the systemmachines vs humans – which is premiumwhile machines and humans are placed in proximity \\xa0robots can be expensive but this doesn’t apply to all types especially those based on robotic process automation (rpa) where the development process incorporates algorithms that significantly reduce costsmoreover think of how domestic robots—be it a vacuum cleaner a lawn mower or a pool cleaner—are increasingly part of our daily lives this level of consumption that robotics has attained makes it affordable to automate tasks in modern homes to obtain greater control security and comfortman and machines togetherthe division between humans and machines has been clear – i’m here the machine is there – but that boundary is getting fuzzier smart prosthetics fuse seamlessly with our bodies making up for lost limbs or providing additional strength stability or resilience as seen in exoskeletons donned by assembly line workerswe use our smartphones symbiotically but what if they were integrated directly into our bodies think a smartphone in the form of a contact lens capable of transparently delivering augmented reality images straight to the brain think it sounds like science fiction think again the first prototypes have already been builtsoon brain-computer interfaces could become seamless as well creating a new synergistic relationship between the cloud and us at that point the question of who knows what would be moot; you ask me a question and i know the answer sometimes that answer will be stored in my own neural circuitry but most of the time it would come from the connection of my neurons to the web our brain’s decision process is influenced by the way it has been “educated” by the cultural context these external factors are influencing our decision processes to the point that in certain situations we can legitimately claim that influence has been so strong that our brains can’t be held accountable for the choices made the point i’m trying to make is that we humans are in symbiosis with our cultural environment and the tools – both physical and conceptual – that we have been taught to use my guess is that the transformation will be subtleconclusionpractically speaking robots growing to the point that they take over the world and then start creating smarter better robots are impractical and should not even be a concern none of this is expected in the near future not by a long shot if you’ve been to an atm waited for a pc to boot up after a catastrophic failure or had a game crash on your x box just when you were about to reach a checkpoint you understand that we are not in a world where machines do everything perfectly right before they can take over all of our jobs they need to be able to do theirs’ flawlessly; until then we can depend on humans to mess up our lives\\xa0this isn’t a win-or-lose situation we’re going to wind up as a partner to our smarter machines and that partnership will be fostered by our augmentation through technology machines will play an essential role in this augmentation and as with any successful technology they will fall below our level of perception in the end the revolution will be silent and invisibleblackcoffer insights 29: swapna g nivashiniya r sri manakula vinayagar engineering college(smvec) puducherry',\n",

continues to become more and more popular and having impacts on many areas of elearning it offers online learners of the future intuitive algorithms and automated delivery of elearning content through modern lms platforms this paper aims to survey various applications of deep learning approaches for developing the resources of the elearning platform in which predictions algorithms and analytics come together to create more personalized future elearning experiences in addition deep learning models for developing the contents of the elearning platform deep learning framework that enable deep learning systems into elearning and its development benefits & future trends of deep learning in elearning the relevant deep learning-based artificial intelligence tools and a platform enabling the developer and learners to quickly reuse resources are clearly summarized thus deep learning has evolved into developing ways to re-purpose existing resources that can mitigate the expense of content development of future elearningit is natural to wonder where you might get ai tools to avoid the time and expense of developing your own don’t worry about the advert of aiaas or “ai as a service” even small education or learning & development professionals can purchase the license of ai tools and components however such types of tools cannot be useful for every e-learning ecosystem but may offer some enticing benefits such as adding standard ai tasks (logic decision making) to your toolbox here are some of the aiaas tools and platforms offered by famous tech giants most of which are cloud-basedmicrosoft azurecloud-based ai services that can be used to build and manage ai applications like image recognition or bot-based appsibm’s watsoncloud-based ai services that can be

services on amazon’s cloudthere are other aiaas platforms such as datarobot petuum and h2o which shows that the field is expandingai will probably not make human workers obsolete at least not for a long time to put some of your fears to bed: the robots are probably not coming for your jobs at least not yet given how artificial intelligence has been portrayed in the media in particular in some of our favorite sci-fi movies it’s clear that the advent of this technology has created fear that ai will one day make human beings obsolete in the workforce after all as technology has advanced many tasks that were once executed by human hands have become automated it’s only natural to fear that the leap toward creating intelligent computers could herald the beginning of the end of work as we know it but i don’t think there is any reason to be so fatalistic a recent paper published by the mit task force on the work of the future entitled “artificial intelligence and the future of work” looked closely at developments in ai and their relation to the world of work the paper paints a more optimistic picturerather than promoting the obsolescence of human labor the paper predicts that ai will continue to drive massive innovation that will fuel many existing industries and could have the potential to create many new sectors for growth ultimately leading to the creation of more jobs while ai has made major strides toward replicating the efficacy of human intelligence in executing certain tasks there are still major limitations in particular ai programs are typically only capable of “specialized” intelligence meaning they can solve only one problem and execute only one task at a time often they can be rigid and unable to respond to any changes in input or perform any “thinking” outside of their prescribed programming humans however possess “generalized intelligence” with the kind of problem-solving abstract thinking and critical judgment that will continue to be important in business human judgment will be relevant if not in every task then certainly throughout every level across all sectors there are many other factors that could limit runaway advancement in ai ai often requires “learning” which can involve massive amounts of data calling into question the availability of the right kind of data and highlighting the need for categorization and issues of privacy and security around such data there is also the limitation of computation and processing power the cost of electricity alone to power one supercharged language model ai was estimated at $46 million another important limitation of note is that data can itself carry bias and be reflective of societal inequities or the implicit biases of the designers who create and input the data if there is bias in the data that is inputted into an ai this bias is likely to carry over to the results generated by the aithere has even been a bill introduced into congress entitled the algorithmic accountability act with the goal of forcing the federal trade commission to investigate the use of any new ai technology for the potential to perpetuate bias based on these factors and many others the mit cci paper argues that we are a long way from reaching a point in which ai is comparable to human intelligence and could theoretically replace human workers entirely\\xa0 provided there is an investment at all levels from education to the private sector and governmental organizations—anywhere that focuses on training and upskilling workers—ai has the potential to ultimately create more jobs not less the question should then become not “humans or computers” but “humans and computers” involved in complex systems that advance industry and prosperity this paper is a fascinating read for anyone hoping to dive deeper into ai and the many potential directions in which it may leadai is becoming standard in all businesses not just in the world of tech a couple of times recently ai has come up in conversation with a client or an associate and i’m noticing a fallacy in how people are thinking about it there seems to be a sense for many that it is a phenomenon that is only likely to have big impacts in the tech world in case you hadn’t noticed the tech world is the world these days don’t ever forget when economist paul krugman said in 1998 that “by 2005 or so it will become clear that the internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s” you definitely don’t want to be behind the curve when it comes to ai \\xa0in fact 90% of leading businesses already have ongoing investments in ai technologies more than half of businesses that have implemented some manner of ai-driven technology report experiencing greater productivity ai is likely to have a strong impact on certain sectors in particular:medical:the potential benefits of utilizing ai in the field of medicine are already being explored the medical industry has a robust amount of data which can be utilized to create predictive models related to healthcare additionally ai has shown to be more effective than physicians in certain diagnostic contextsautomotive:we’re already seeing how ai is impacting the world of transportation and automobiles with the advent of autonomous vehicles and autonomous navigation ai will also have a major impact on manufacturing including within the automotive sectorcybersecurity:cybersecurity is front of mind for many business leaders especially considering the spike in cybersecurity breaches throughout 2020 attacks rose 600% during the pandemic as hackers capitalized on people working from home on less secure technological systems and wi-fi networks ai and machine learning will be critical tools in identifying and predicting threats in cybersecurity ai will also be a crucial asset for security in the world of finance given that it can process large amounts of data to predict and catch instances of fraude-commerce:ai will play a pivotal role in e-commerce in the future in every sector of the industry from user experience to marketing to fulfillment and distribution we can expect that moving forward ai will continue to drive e-commerce including through the use of chat-bots shopper personalization image-based targeting advertising and warehouse and inventory automationai can have a big impact on the job searchif you are moving forward with the hope that a hiring manager may give you the benefit of the doubt on a small misstep within the application you might be in for a rude awakening ai already plays a major role in the hiring process so much so that up to 75% of resumes are rejected by an automated applicant tracking system or ats before they even reach a human being\\xa0 in the past recruiters have had to devote considerable time to poring over resumes to look for relevant candidates data from linkedin shows that recruiters can spend up to 23 hours looking over resumes for one successful hireincreasingly however resume scanning is being done by ai-powered programs in 2018 67% of hiring managers stated that ai was making their jobs easier despite the increasing prevalence of automation and algorithms in the hiring process many have been critical of the use of certain types of ai by hiring managers based on the charge that it can perpetuate and ever create more bias in hiring one particular example is illustrated by hirevue a startup whose initial services included technology that aimed to use facial recognition software and psychology to determine the potential effectiveness of a candidate in a certain role the electronic privacy information center filed a lawsuit with the federal trade commission alleging that this software had the potential to perpetuate bias and prejudice hirevue discontinued the use of facial recognition software in early 2021 and now uses audio analysis and natural language processing it’s clear that the use of certain types of ai in the hiring process will likely be controversial as new technology develops however if potential employers are using ai to process your application there is no reason that you cannot be utilizing similar technology to your advantagejobscan is an excellent resource that provides similar resume scanning to what would be used by a hiring manager by comparing your resume to a job description jobscan will give you information on how to tweak your resume so that it is a good match for a certain position with the goal of “beating” an applicant tracking system (ats)jobseer is a browser add-on and another great ai-based tool for those on the job market based on a scan of your resume as well as keywords and skills related to your desired jobs jobseer will help match you with the job listings that best fit your experience for each listing you get a rating based on how well you are aligned with the particular posting as well as recommendations of skills to add to better position your resume and experiencerezi: now as a disclaimer i would never encourage you to turn your resume writing over to a bot but rezi is an awesome ai-based resume builder that includes templates to help you design a resume that is sure to check the boxes when it comes to applicant tracking systems this is a great jumping-off point to kickstart a new resume\\xa0 another great way to use this type of tool is to generate a new resume and compare it to your current resume to see how it stacks up and identify some areas for improvement ai is also a great place to focus your energy if you are looking to upskill in your career or make your professional profile more competitive in the job market especially when you consider that ai will have such far-reaching impacts across many industriesai and machine learning are at the top of many lists of the most important skills in today’s job market jobs requesting ai or machine-learning skills are expected to increase by 71% in the next five years if you’d like to expand your knowledge base in this arena consider some of the great free online course offerings that focus on ai skills if you are tech-savvy it would be wise to dive deep and learn as much as you can about interacting in the ai space if your skills lie elsewhere it is important to recognize that ai will have a big impact and to the extent of your abilities you should try to understand the fundamentals of how it functions in different sectors ai is definitely here to stay whether we like it or not personally i don’t think we have anything to be afraid of the best way to move forward

these terms really meana technological revolution simply means that we are in a period where better and newer technologies replace the others to get the job done faster and better we are in an era with rapid innovations where machines are being compared to humansfig: technological revolutionso then what is machine learningmachine learning is basically the application of artificial intelligence into electronic systems to enable them to learn and enhance themselves without being programmed by humans it is the evolution and development of computer programs that can access data and then use it to advance themselves whether you know it or not you use machine learning-powered applications dailynow what is artificial intelligenceat its simplest form artificial intelligence is a field which combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem-solving\\xa0in simple words artificial intelligence is the technology that facilitates these machines to perform human like behaviourjust like every other industry machine learning is playing its role in the finance and banking industry too in most cases where a human would perform the same task by performing the same calculations or following the same process can be taught to the machine which can now perform it by itselflet us discuss a few examples of the applications that we might have come in our day to day running which are a result of machine learning in this industry:portfolio managementrisk underwritingalgorithmic tradingfraud detectionprocess automationcustomer onboardingcustomer churndecision makingprocess automationportfolio managementin earlier days an investor would need to consult a financial advisor to understand hisher risk appetite and advise accordingly today using machine learning algorithms there exists the concept of a “robo-advisor” that requires any user to give certain inputs about their financial status and goals and calculates their risk tolerance and constructs and idle portfolio allocation for them young users today find this extremely useful rather than physically visiting an advisor and paying a fee for doing sorisk underwritingunderwriting is one of the core functions for most financial institutions especially banks and insurance companies where they are required to underwrite the risk of the customers before loaning out money or insurance policies these underwriting activities are based on trends and thumb rules industrywide the same has been introduced through machine learning which is able to underwrite risks today on a larger and more accurate scalealgorithmic tradingmachine learning is a mathematical model that tracks market information analyses massive data sources and study market conditions simultaneously to detect patterns which can be used for trading this is humanly impossible to do in a fraction of time algorithmic systems can make millions of trades daily often known as “high-frequency trading” it is highly believed that deep learning is playing its role in calibrating real-time trading decisionsfraud detectionwith the increase in use and dependency on computers for financial transactions came the data security risk there is an ample amount of valuable data stored online available to create potential risk machine learning thus helped in fraud detection by detecting anomalies in transactions and flagging them for scrutiny based on the risk factors defined by the institutions fraud identification in insurance claims credit card payments identity theft account theft are all areas in fraud detection that machine learning can help inprocess automationprocess automation is one of the most common applications of machine learning in finance the technology has helped in replacing manual work automate repetitive tasks to avoid redundancy and as a result increase productivity machine learning has benefitted these organizations to optimize costs improve customer experiences and scale up their services some examples of financial and banking firms using process automation are the use of chatbots automated calls paperwork automation and gamified employee trainingcustomer onboardingin this highly competitive industry customer acquisition and the customer onboarding process is highly relevant in building a good customer relationship at any stage during the onboarding a slight inconvenience or delay can act as a barrier machine learning-enabled complete automation in this process for these financial and banking institutions today from opening an account filing for any application can be completed within a few minutes with utmost ease with ai customers’ behavioral patterns have been studied to improvise and make the whole process efficient and user-friendlycustomer churnwith the multitude of offerings and availability of a plethora of options customer stickiness is a big problem faced by financial firms customer churn forecasting is one of the best big data use cases it helps

industry better and more efficient with each new adaptation machine learning algorithms have the capability to deal with a lot more than human capacity along with eliminating human error as even the algorithms are constantly learning and innovating they can serve as a bridge to a completely flawless automated financial system in the future nonetheless the challenges of high cost and lack of resources that come along play a significant role in how early these firms can adopt these technologies but even then the future seems bright as the industry has enough adopters and prospects ready to

kidding “funny right before some of you say that this joke isn’t realistic “how can an automaton tell you a joke” but what if i tell you in 2017 “sofia” the robot made a joke on the show good morning britain who thought computers could tell us a joke hard to believe well the idea of giving computers human-enjoy thinking has now become a reality thanks to the technological advancement in ai in the last decadebefore diving deep into how ai can impact the future of work let’s begin with the simple question: what’s ai artificial intelligence provides machines the power to think from data the machine uses the patterns and trends found in data and makes its decision but cannot create thought beyond these patterns and trendsfig: impact of robots on employmentswith the rise of ai humans are divided into one question are machines human’s friend or foe tech executives and politicians on conference stages campaign rallies and even science fiction hollywood movies like carbon black westworld minority report and ex machina have given their take on this question some believe ai will help us solve problems while others believe that the rise of ai will result in destruction and maybe the end of the world we all knowstephen hawking made it no secret of his concern about the rise of superhuman ai that eventually would escape earth to a new planet no this isn’t a plot of black mirror right now superhumans may not be a reality but ai is“homo deus” the emergence of the new digital god using ai god must also worry as ai might take his jobhere’s some career advice have you thought about being a robot the fear that ai would automate all jobs in the future eventually leaving all humans jobless has been daunting for many workers today statistics show that nearly 37% of workers worry about losing their jobs to robots while another thought that many people believe is that though the rise of ai with result in automating most of the jobs in the future however it also will create millions of new job opportunitiesai is already replacing most manual and repetitive tasks for example buying a metro ticket or a movie ticket is now almost a human-less interaction each year the number of industrial robot jobs increases by 14 % at this rate it’s predicted that the 20 million jobs in the manufacturing industry will be replaced by robots due to automationthe coronavirus pandemic and recession have boosted the demand for automation the robotic process automation (rpa) software industry has experienced an increase of 1953% in the year 2021 coronavirus pandemic has increased interest in technology that reduces human contact as minimal for making workplaces safeour workplaces will look much different in the next five to ten years ai will help humans in simplifying repetitive processes the two most important catalysts for the future of work are the two d’s- digitization and datafication digitalization is converting data to digital formats (computer-readable) for example text to html analog video to youtube video digitization helps in increasing data exponentially datafication is quantifying human life to data and improving the data-driven business model by 2025 it is forecasted that the digital transformation space will build in a $3294 billion industryone thing is clear no data no future of work what we find is that the future of data and the future of work will go hand in hand the total volume of data in the datasphere that is created captured copied and consumed in the world is predicted to reach 175 zettabytes by 2025 to give you a much better picture for understanding if we represent the digital universe as stacks of tablets there would be 2725 stacks from earth to the moonit’s time to prepare for the data-dominated future as industry 40fourth industrial revolution has begun so let’s see how artificial intelligence will affect the following fields:human resource: nowadays recruiters use ai-powered tools for hiring workers using these tools recruiters get insights into a candidate’s skills personality and even check whether the candidate is fit for the organization for example the company allyo first identifies high-potential candidates through assessment and smart screening and then automatically schedules interviews using ai hr departments at large companies receive hundreds of resumes for a job opening entry-level roles focusing on screening and scheduling will be automated ai will automate specific hr jobs not hr roles a deloitte study found that ai has already eliminated 800000 low-skilled jobs in the uk but 35 million new jobs were also created roles that focus on complex decisions like resolving disputes within a department will continue to be a very human endeavorfinance and accounting: in 2015 a report from accenture named “finance 2020: death by digital” predicted that 40 percent of transactional accounting work would be automated by 2020 has technology replaced the human factor well ai has created new jobs involving managing the ai system and using the information to create insights for example accounting software has already automated bookkeeping tasks that used to be done by humans but that’s only opened the door for former bookkeepers to learn skills needed to run and manage the software for employers and clients advisors are another crucial role of the accounting and finance team using the information gained from transactions in books the team creates insights to improve business strategy owing to automation the team spends more time analyzing numbersmarketing and sales: marketing automation has helped companies strategize the proper utilization of the company’s resources managing time and achieving budget targets marketing automation has helped to draw conclusions at a scale no marketer ever would in this process marketers and machines both excel in different parts marketers using ai tools drive more conversions in less time human intelligence with technology can help identify the right customers to talk to and at the right time modern marketers understand the insights from any marketing campaign and create it into effective messagingengineering: technology is changing in a blink of an eye the technologies used five years ago in the industry have become obsolete today engineers will have to keep up with the technological advancements and keep upgrading their skills to stay relevant in the industry learning to work alongside machines and designing work such that interaction better humans and machines are better are going to be important skills for engineers in the futurefig: robots takes place the job role of manin the 18th and 19th centuries the rise of the industrial revolution centuries led to millions of people losing their jobs because of scientific advancements but that also ended in creating millions of other jobs statisticians have said when automation destroys jobs people find new ones thus ai holds a more optimistic picture for the futurein the future ai is not going to replace humans rather make jobs more humane ai will disrupt millions of middle and entry-level jobs in the next few years

the new machine programs ai is all set to take over the humans in their workplace as no other did now we are not only in competition with other beings but with robots too and robots will overcome us in our fields of workat present we are being surrounded by ai from dusk till dawn from facial recognition present in our mobile application to dating websitesapplications which uses decision making as their algorithms and learn from the past data as well it is believed that ai has grown over 270% over the last yearsfirst let us know what ai is and all the fuss going on about itai as defined by the internet is simply ‘simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions’ this translates to it can work as a human being just at fast speed and with 100% accuracyin my definition i would define ai as the god form of human beingsnow the question that arises is what does ai entails for the futureai is fancy enough to continue existing in our minds all the time but it does come with certain limitations and threats which is a cause for a peaceful sleep for most of the workers with its introduction to different areas of the workplace it is clear that half of the human jobs would be taken up by ai and then there would arise a need for more jobs for humans in new upcoming ai-based ventures in different industries thereby giving us our fair share back to usin a survey it was found that some believed that ai will be devastating for humans and while some professionals and tech-savvy people believed that inculcating ai technology into business and our daily lives would be a remarkable step as it will lead to the flourishment of business in the future and give them a competitive edge over their rivalspeople believed that when these advanced technologies would come together to work with humans they will produce a smarter strategic decision with productive collaborative practices more modern technology prevailing in the organization will lead to stress reduction and produce more satisfying results thereby making the organization more efficientthe organizations who are in use of the ai technology responds by saying that their managers are more comfortable using ai and are accustomed to it and the organizations are now looking forward to having integration of higher-end technology systems as it is believed that new technology will result in more productivity thereby making more profits in the long runmany jobs today require ai and humans working in collaboration which creates a positive signal that in the future to humans would be working closely with the technology beyond just training and developing these machines humans would be working in close vicinity with them and making decisions on how to act on the result that is given by the machineit can be said that both the ai advanced technology and human can’t remain in the workforce without each other as the technology will produce accurate and top-notch results but it requires someone to make deliveryeg in a firm an ai-based system produces results based on historical data but there is a need for someone to analyze and communicate and present this data to the respective stakeholders whether inside or outside of the organizationvarious uses of artificial intelligence technology in day-to-day functions in regards to interactions with humans are:chatbotsemail curationai powered advertisingautomated image recognitionself-sufficient drivingvoice activation and much morehere in this figure a represents ‘artificial intelligence’ and b represents ‘humans’ artificial intelligence as we know works on algorithms neural networks and deep learning which all are analytical tools that help ai in taking analytical decisions based on the data providedwhereas humans on the other hand take higher-level decisions based on ‘intuition’ sometimes which refers to the gut feeling that generates in humans concerning any situation or challengeai alone can’t work to handle critical situations on its own as it needs humans for it to reciprocate them and share the information with stakeholders and humans alone can’t anticipate much on the accurate and fast-paced analytical solutions to the problems persisting in place of the situationthe strength of humans and ai working in synergy can be surprisingly beneficial and advantageous to organizationsartificial intelligence and jobsit is believed that machines in the future would be eating up our traditional jobs but the reality seems to be turning otherwisethe future trend shows that in future the ai-powered technology would take up jobs that were being done by humans but in return would produce more jobs that would require human interference with them as and when the newer technology is approaching more and more countries are now proceeding towards gig economies and so in the future we can witness an increase in freelance jobs and the permanent labor market norms could reduce drasticallysome of the jobs today will be replaced by ai which is in the transportation or retail commerce sector that can be 100% automated in the future years there is an ‘amazon go’ store that uses this technology which goes by the name ‘just walk out technology’ wherein there is no need for any human-induced workforce and all the operations are carried out by ai-powered technologies which is indeed a breakthrough technology in today’s worldrather than eating up our jobs ai in return will be creating more jobs in the future by creating massive innovations thereby fueling up many new industries and thereby giving us our fair share of jobs backthere will be a lot of demand placed on the upcoming young workforce which is also categorized as ‘gen z’ they are expected to know more about technology and would be high in demand \\xa0these young generations are required to learn new skills which are needed to survive in the dynamic changing environment and as most of the activities that are carried out by workers will be automated there will be demand for people working in the back office and maintaining and developing the technology to its best versions \\xa0artificial intelligence and its constraintsai powered technology has its limitations which makes it a rigid system to hold on to and also which makes it a costly affair at the initial stage \\xa0it was predicted that the cost of electricity to power a supercharged ai model was around $46 million so this super-powered ai can be purchased only by big fortune firms and thereby creating more value to their net worthone of the major limitations of ai is that it can contain biased data as the scientists who put in the data can create biasedness and so the resultant output of the same would have a biased reportthese machines as do not have neuroscience-based technology in them yet which enables them to carry human emotions to understand complex situations and a creative way out of that they tend to have a lack of out of box thinking which in the case is rigid in themselves as they are programmed to work on a single task and they cannot perform more than a single task at the same timeit is also believed that there exists no creativity among the computer no matter it is fast-paced but they are not intelligentpreparing for the futurebusiness and organizationbusinesses and organizations need to understand and anticipate the opportunities that the future holds for them and they need to start training their employees based on today’s dynamic changing technology while it’s still unclear what does the future holds for us but the anticipation of it could benefit us in several waysas we are unclear about what the future looks like we need to think in probable terms how it could turn out to be and then employ specific training programs for the employees of the organizationthe training the employees are needed to be done on a continuous and lifetime basis which means that education won’t be only limited to pg degrees but will be now a lifetime process of learningas the covid-19 changed the scenario of the work patterns around the world we now need to think strategically about the working dynamics of the future and how does it look like compared to the pre-covid and post-covid scenarioemployees will be playing a major role in transforming the organizations and work practices in the upcoming future so organizations need to select and recruit the best candidates among the pool and then provide them with best practices of the new machines and make proficient in their area of work policies need to be developed to hire the best people and then retaining the talent in the organizationthere needs to be a continuous scanning of the environment by the organizations to

lies a possibility in future certain years from now we could have machines who will have general human intelligence who would be able to answer deep meaningful questions asking ‘why are the curtains blue’ would be able to clean cars play politics and tell jokes to us and by using deep and machine learning programs their level of intelligence would be beyond mathematical calculations to us that’s how good machines will be in the future but to make ourselves competitive with machines we would need to train ourselves for the impending ambiguous future ahead of ushumans and machines need to work

not fear aiwhat is aiai is the abbreviation of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence is often defined as a set of various technologies which will be brought together to permit machines to act with what appears to be human-like levels of intelligence this includes learning rules required to make certain decisions and reasoning to arrive at certain conclusions learning from past experiences and self-correctionai is of two typesnarrowweak ai – ai solution designed and trained for a specific taskstrong ai – an ai solution whose intelligence matches that of a human brain across multiple & differentiated taskkey moments in the ai journey1940expectations that machines could match humans in terms of general intelligence by that we mean machines could have the capability to find out reason and react1950alan turing develops the turing test; a test to determine whether a machine is intelligenthowever it wasn’t for another 60 years or so that any program was deemed to have

intelligence (ai) is here to remain and lots of people aren’t happy after all it’s hard to embrace something that would displace about 40 percent of human jobs within the next 15 years in an interview for cbs’s hour kai-fu lee (a chinese ai expert) also mentioned truck drivers chauffeurs waiters and chefs as a number of the professions that will be disruptedbut if you were to ask the experts they might unwaveringly confirm that no matter all the noise ai is here to profit us all case in point an executive briefing by the mckinsey global institute revealed that ai and automation are creating opportunities for the economy society and businessthat said it’s time to repress the widespread idea of artificial intelligence taking jobs so let’s highlight a number of the useful developments you’ll expect from this technological phenomenonai will create jobswhile the relationship between artificial intelligence and jobs is a matter of hot debate it is still safe to say that ai will indeed offer new opportunities according to the planet economic forum report robots and ai will create as many ai jobs as they displace this conclusion is entirely viable as it is easy to identify some of the many careers in artificial intelligence for example data scientists who evaluate the decisions made by ai algorithms to eliminate any biases apart from that some other ai occupations include:transparency analysts: people tasked with classifying the varied sorts of opacity for algorithms smart-system interaction modelers: experts who develop machine behavior based on employee behavior machine-relations managers: people that champion the greater use of algorithms that perform well as far because the competition for jobs between humans and robots goes worth noting is that there are jobs that ai can’t replace roles that need leadership empathy and delegation are samples of the various jobs that are safe from automationai will eliminate bias and a variety of challenges at workautomation will stir positive change in the workplace when ai is employed during recruitment or maybe performance management all workers are going to be evaluated in an unbiased fact-based manner in turn human resources managers can get to consider other essential strategic undertakings that ensure balance within the workplaceai can help hr departments to use machine learning (ml) in discovering where issues like bias stem from and assist them to act accordingly faster ml shines in identifying instances of bias in turn this may promote fairness and variety within the work settingai in the workplace will steer business-outcome strategiesthe impact of ai in business is already felt and this is often expected to continue through to the longer term a few years from now ai-oriented architecture is forecasted to require the lead in assisting businesses to hold out operations in additional comprehensive ways thus shifting them from traditional data science and machine learning models it will be necessary to maneuver to business outcomes because ai will play an important role in multiple aspects of the business while there is no way of telling the future of artificial intelligence in business for sure it makes sense for owners to keep up with the evolution to avoid being left behindai will boost innovation within the workplace in the longer termthe workforce of the longer term will lean more towards innovation and creativity businesses have spent higher a part of the previous couple of years studying ai automation and the way they will leverage it to realize results fast with statistics showing that workers spend up to 40 percent of their hours at work performing repetitive tasks every business should consider automating any functions which will be automated automation is not new; machines have been replacing human labor in different areas for decadeshowever within the coming years mundane daily tasks will become fully automated already 39 percent of organizations were completely reliant on automation in 2018 with repetitive tasks taken care of employees can focus their energies on high-value customer-oriented tasks and collaboration the designs of workplaces and workflows will also change with the implementation of ai technology more people will begin to figure more closely with machines as companies will strive to become more agilecompanies that implement ai in their business strategy will experience dramatic improvements in their customer experiences and their employees are going to be more motivated encouraging creativity rather than the performance of repetitive tasks gives workers more fulfillment in their jobs as wellwith another technology ai will positively impact the worldwith the web of things and ai working hand in hand identifying trends and solving problems within the business world will become more convenient and also sustainable ai alongside other technologies is predicted to vary the planet by impacting the way businesses run with time we’ll be ready to combine both human and artificial brains to seek out solutions to major global problemsit will even be easier to foresee problems with more accuracy and nip them at the bud with the help of ai but these positive impacts can only be felt if stakeholders are transparent and mindful in their use of the technology for the greater good of everyone elserobotics and ai will boost productivityaccording to a report by pwc 54 percent of companies confirm that the implementation of ai-driven solutions in their companies has already improved productivity ai and automation even once they are implemented partially have unlimited potential for any business workers’ skills attitude training command chain and workflows protocols are a number of the leading productivity challenges that companies faceapart from increasing productivity ai systems will help businesses to chop down on costs improve the standard of their products or services and make better customer profiles as a result companies also will get higher profits which may be shared among stakeholders as dividends or reinvest it back within the business improved productivity also means firms are going to be ready to sell their products at lower prices thereby creating more demand among customers and more job opportunities for workers businesses can therefore use human labor to take up those jobs that have been created by ai and cannot be automatedfinal thoughts on the impact of ai on jobsartificial intelligence isn’t showing any signs of slowing down soon it’ll become another necessity of life a bit like the web but for now more and more businesses are beginning to realize how invaluable ai automation and data interpretation are though machines will take some jobs initially the roles created by automation will also keep soaring within the next few yearswill we’ve reached the purpose of accelerating human intelligence by artificial means who knows what we all know however is that those that are going to be sought-after in ai and employment are individuals who have the relevant skills there’s work that not even the machines can do; so we should make

doomsday scenarios are pretty irresponsible after all in the next five to ten years ai is going to deliver so many improvements and the quality of our lives it is a renaissance a golden age of machine- learning and artificial intelligence that was the realm of science fiction for the last several decades ai is probably the most important thing humanities that have ever worked which is more profound than any work with technology as it is important to harness the benefits and while minimizing the downside is focusing on autonomous systems like self-driving cars seen as the mother of all ai projects and has made applications like self-driving technology viable for the first time three things happen at the same time number one data collection and data processing became easier because of better technologies right um you need data to fuel ai training and that’s been one of the big drivers the second thing that has happened is that computer processing has become faster that’s like the engine so no matter how much fuel you have if you don’t have that engine and processing the data on a timeframe that’s reasonable was just not possible and the third thing that’s happened is that new algorithms have been developed which has made ai much more powerful so #technology has been changing and developing at a pace that’s much faster than ever before and we have not been used to this rapid pace of change which means that we have not been used to thinking about how it’s going to impact our immediate future the most important factor responsible for the growth of ai is google and its ai what google’s done is given all of us the power to get the relevant information we want at our fingertips this has created a shift in how things are bought but it didn’t happen overnight this started in 2004 but the major change only happens to start 2012 onwards google’s taken away about 65% of sales people’s jobs that were primarily order takers and the ones that are remaining are likely to be gone over the next decadein present several ai projects are helping in diagnosing diseases better match up drugs with people depending on what they’re sick they can get treated better so it’s going to help a whole lot of people get treated and get better #healthcare than would have had access to it before if you look at self-driving cars they’re going to be safer than people driving cars

application we just launched for anybody with visual impairment ass it uses the latest cutting-edge computer vision technology to give anyone the ability to see so anyone who has dyslexia can now use ai to be able to read better and with the\\xa0 latest release of windows 10 has this capability called ij’s which enable the eye muscle that the gaze can help to type like the two sides of the coin there are negative impacts of ai as well\\xa0 bill gates ellen musk also tech giants in a way their views are pessimistic to say the least they warned against the potential of ai to replace humans in the workplace and ella masks even went as far as to claim that ai is the biggest existential threat to mankind because of the loss of a job when you think about a job or a career choice if a majority of the tasks that comprise that career choice is likely to be these vulnerable tasks then that is a career at risk in the future so what are the tasks that ai will find hard to do anything unpredictable anything that requires skills like creative thinking or empathy or interpersonal skills but it’s important to understand tomorrow whether google is there or not artificial intelligence is going to progress you know technology has just nature it’s that it’s going to evolve as\\xa0 technology and in particular ai can in fact bring more empowerment more inclusiveness and at the same time it is important to be clear-eyed about displacement and unintended consequences like any other technology and work both skills so that people can find the jobs of the future create new jobs also the policy decisions that help people as they go through this change people already unhappy because of machine learning artificial intelligence as they think\\xa0 if they’re not innovative enough or not creative enough your job will be taking away by a lot of machines ai for business going to affect the future of work specifically there are jobs that are at more risk of being taken over by ai and automation there is very wide dissonance on this there are different reports that have been shared by\\xa0 oxford study that says 47% of us jobs are at risk of automation over the next few years meanwhile the general population and workers think differently a recent study conducted by college actually identifies that 97% of workers believe that most jobs will be automated but not their own this suggests that the general public needs to be educated on which jobs are\\xa0 susceptible to this risk which are not and businesses need to be aware of the forthcoming skills gap of course not all jobs are equal the oxford study that highlights this they examined 700 participants and found the generalist occupations that require creative knowledge or innovation are at least risk the same is true for occupations in education healthcare media and arts jobs on the flip side jobs like telemarketers junior lawyers accountants are at most risk in short there is a simple rule of thumb if your job is in some way predictable or routine the risk of automation is much higher if a job doesn’t require innovation or creativity then the return on investment for companies is higher on machines than real-time employees machines are faster can’t be distracted and can work 247 this is actually good for creative marketers because ai and automation can serve to augment their jobs rather than substituting them as impact of emerging technologies on the creative economy they stated that artificial intelligence is changing\\xa0 creative content from beginning to end by 2030 ai will be able to write high school essays code in python composed top 40s chart songs and make creative videos but all of these advancements also come with risks and costs take a look at this report by the global commission on the future of work in the absence of effective transition policies many people will have to accept lower skilled and lower paying jobs high-skilled workers are taking less cognitively demanding jobs displacing less educated workers and this is already happening also technological dividends are being unevenly distributed among firms a very limited amount of companies tend to dominate when it comes to big data just think about google and facebook today they alone are responsible for 70% of the referral marketing traffic and\\xa0 receive more than 50% of total global advertising budget so the question is in businesses workers and social institutions go into the same direction if companies and public policy leaders can understand the evolving landscape they can help the workforce anticipate the upcoming challenges technology and the demographic changes are leading to a smaller workforce compared to the previous generation and a workforce that has to pursue many careers during their time of work we need to provide workers with an environment where they can continuously upskill and grow governments will have to re-evaluate the educational system we will have to continuously learn and grow and companies will have to redesign their structure and their culture around technology just like during the industrial revolution we are heading into a new age and the great transformation that we’re about to see by 2022 it is estimated that 20 to 25 percent of the labor force will be displaced within 10 to 20 years however this is also an opportunity for people to get ahead for which different ways have to be find to attract and retain highly skilled workers and allow them the time to up skill themselves even during work hours and it is a\\xa0 good way\\xa0 to develop a learning community to benefit from each other and also to use technology to supplement goal tracking and\\xa0 efforts instead of as a distraction in short what we are doing is\\xa0 to bridge the dissonance and it is imperative to build a\\xa0 map of how ai and automation will affect\\xa0 industry and\\xa0 company if this is an economic imperative how do people feel about committing itself to a lifelong approach to knowledge as\\xa0 these risks are important but it is important to do things like from being upfront to have ethical charters like ai safety and to be very transparent and open and how we perceive progress there and figure out global frameworks by which we can engage just like paris agreement and climate change by using\\xa0 such forums bring people together as they engage on the hard questions and it will emerge answers and on the question of whether ai is a threat or not artificial intelligence is not\\xa0 a threat because there is a rare case where people need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive because i think by the time we are reactive in ai regulation it’s too late right now we have machine learning algorithms that can solve an incredibly complex problem beyond any human intelligence\\xa0 as they are mere machines that can be given enormous data set and they come up with brilliant correlations and insights but they’re not going

many developed and developing countriesthe sars- cov2 came into the spotlight in december 2019 and has impacted most of the countries till then nearly 131 million peoples were infected worldwide and resulting in deaths of around 29 million according to world health organisation (who) most of the countries dealt with the new virus by imposing strict lockdowns and social distancing to control the spread of the virus these policies caused adverse effects worldwide one of the most important impacts of the covid-19 pandemic is on the environmentthere have been few positive impacts on the environment due to lockdown like air pollution has decreased dramatically as people were asked to stay in their houses due to the lockdowns there has also been a sharp decline in environmental noise environmental noise can be well defined as the unwanted or harmful outdoor sounds caused by human activities like noise emitted by road traffics air traffics rail traffics and industrial activities it is one of the most important challenges in the modern era as noise pollution can cause adverse effects on humans as well as harm many animals too the imposition of lockdown and quarantine by various nation’s governments has caused people to remain back at their homes because of this the movement of people from one place to a different place has reduced significantly and the use of personal and public transport has also decreased due to all these changes the environmental noise generated in most of the cities has dropped substantiallywater pollution at beaches have reduced significantly and many animals were spotted back in the cities but the covid-19 virus has also generated many negative and indirect effect on the environmentto begin with some of the developed countries have halted their sustainability program during the pandemic in the united states and in many other european nation-states waste recycling plants have been suspended in many municipalities and cities due to the concern of the virus getting spread at the recycling centers this has resulted in an increase in the use of single-use plastic bags instead of the re-usable bags by many leading restaurants firms and corporations for instance starbucks a leading coffee company during the month of march 2020 has announced a short-lived ban on the utilization of recyclable and reusable cupsfurthermore with most of the people staying indoors because of the lockdown majority of the department stores shops restaurants and food outlets are closed making an online purchase and food delivery are quite high this has created more consumption and demand for fossil fuels due to the transportation and mobility of these goods to each individual there has been an enormous upsurge of medical waste- because most of the products employed by healthcare professionals are usually single-use items that can be used only once before they are disposed of some of these wastes include used masks personal protection kits and gloves for instance nearly 200 tons of medical waste were generated during the peak of the pandemic breakout in wuhan china this is 50 tones more than the average waste generated before the outbreak in wuhanthese organic and inorganic wastes generated due to the policies crafted by the government takes a heavy toll on the environment and can cause environmental issues like water pollution air pollution soil erosion and can harm the local flora and faunathe demand for masks during the pandemic has become skyrocketing but the materials required for the production of these masks are highly dangerous for the environment as they are generally composed of non-woven fabrics polyester polystyrene polyethylene and polycarbonate are some common materials used for the surgical mask with density lying between 20grams to 25 gramssq meter these materials are mostly resistant to liquids and are plastic-based products with a really high afterlife after being discarded if not treated properly without discarding they end up filling the landfills and the oceans making it dangerous to aquatic lifeforms for example recently the environment in hong kong has started degrading drastically during the pandemic with the accumulation of these clinical wasteswith recycling plants on hold piles of small mountains of wastes and their depositions at open areas are formed due to the increasing number of unrecycled wastes generated every day this makes the surrounding more vulnerable and also creating a high risk of air pollutions as the dumped open wastes decays into methane (ch4) a greenhouse gas hence increasing the risk of global warming too\\xa0 not only the surroundings are getting affected by these careless methods but the local people are also getting affected if the excess methane gets accumulated in the earth’s atmosphere due to piles of unrecycled wastes this could result in increases in earth’s average temperature and can be harmful to future generationsmany protected and endangered flora and fauna are facing much greater risks due to the imposition of the lockdown many countries under lockdown have made people stay inside their homes the employees ngos and volunteers working in these protected areas like national parks marine conservation zones and wildlife sanctuaries are made to stay at home making these protected and endangered flora and fauna unattended this has also led to an increase in many illegal activities like wildlife hunting illegal deforestation and fishing activities due to the absence of these people the prohibition of eco-tourism has also led to a significant financial drop in the economy of these protected areassome nations like china have asked the local authorities and native government bodies to increase the amount of disinfection routine mainly to increase the dosage of chlorine in the wastewater treatment plant to prevent the spread of the covid-19 virus however according to who (2020) no solid evidence has been found on the survival of the virus on the lifespan of the virus in wastewater as well as in drinking water despite the fact that excessive amounts of chlorine in water can cause harmful problems and issues associated with people’s health like bladder cancer and it also damages its cellsthe covid-19 is a reminder that the health of the planet is also linked to the health of humans evidence proves that the virus is zoonotic meaning it can be transmitted between people and animals they are accountable for seventy-five percent of all emerging infectious diseases in the world with the virus infecting millions of people every day across the globe various governments and agencies’ top priority is to regulate the spread of the virus by shifting the spotlight on the management and treatment of wastes (especially the clinical and medical waste)\\xa0 likewise at the same time we as responsible individuals need to step up and follow the necessary guideline and precautions for the disposal of the waste and medical gearsin spite of various data showing that the pollutions have reduced significantly during the pandemic history has witnessed a rise in pollution during any “post-financial crisis” \\xa0a similar case was observed during the 2008 financial crash – although there was a temporary decrease in emissions of 13% was observed but as the economy recovered in 2010 emissions were at an all-time high after all only through sheer mutual empathy and goodwill that the world will emerge stronger after this global pandemic to prevent future outbreaks we must address regularly the threats to the ecosystems and wildlife including habitat loss illegal trade pollution and climate change as human life depends on earth’s lifeif you live near a spacious outdoor area like the desert or an empty road lined with trees and you realize it’s the only safe surface-less space to take a walk in then you begin to realize the beauty of nature the point is not to remain indoors but to avoid being

              " '“data is the new oil” has become the most important trendline of the 21st century the reason for this is the advancements in the fields related to data analysis the field of ai machine learning statistics and data mining all deal with data and are developing at such a staggering pace that these fields have become the most popular buzzwords these daysbuzzwords are originated through technical terms but often the underlying essence is ignored through fashionable use and mainly used to impress this is the main reason for the misconception amongst people ai ml stats data mining and many other fields related to the analysis of data are most often mistook for one and the same thing thus all these words are often used interchangeably to convey one and the same thing but this is not true at allthe only similarity between these disciplines is that all of these disciplines are related to the analysis of the data and converting this data into “information”in academics while learning ai machine learning statistics and data mining the academic approach only wander in the technical definitions and concepts but the underlying essence and the aim of the discipline remain unexplored same is the case with most of the articles out there which try to explain the difference thus becoming the primary cause of confusion between learners hence this article explains the difference by explaining the philosophy and the aims of each of the disciplines rather than wandering in the technical definitionsthen what is the difference between ai machine learning statistics and data miningthe essential difference between these disciplines lies in their “aims” and the approach taken to achieve those aimsthe aims of each of these fields\\xa0are explained in detail in the following sections:artificial intelligence:the aim of artificial intelligence is to understand intelligent entities then to satisfy this aim we must first understand what is intelligence and what makes an agent intelligent agent the answer to all these questions can be found by studying intelligent agents and the best example of an intelligent agent can be found by just standing in front of a mirror yes humans are the best examples of intelligent entities thus in the 1900s researchers began exploring the thought process the reasoning process of humans as human beings were considered as an ideal intelligent agent mimicking human behavior became the aim of ai in the initial years of the research after setting this goal studies and experiments began and the most famous experiment conducted in the initial years to achieve this aim was the turing test turing defined intelligent behavior as the ability to achieve human-level performance in all cognitive tasks sufficient to fool an interrogator but this test received criticism as only mimicking human behavior is not exactly intelligence because intelligence should be related to the working of the human brain as without the human brain intelligence has no meaning\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 thus mimicking human thought processes and reasoning became the transformed aim the field of psychology and philosophy also resonate with this aim that is to understand the human thought process the difference is that ai not only tries to understand the thought process but to mimic it build it the collaboration of these fields resulted in models such as neural networks which try to mimic the function of neurons present in the human brain so basically this initial aim was human-centered and humans were considered as the ideal intelligent agentconcurrently the field of computer science was developing at a greater pace with the advances in computer science the experiments and theories could be easily tested and validated as programs were being applied to solve real-life problems it was found that computers performed better than humans at some tasks that are really complex for humans one of the best examples of this could be the chess-playing program an ai program defeated the world’s best chess player garry kasparov this incident indicated that human intelligence is not the ultimate intelligence or else a human would have been able to defeat the ai program this leads to a question is human intelligence the ideal intelligenceas computers became more advanced they proved to be better than humans at certain complex tasks that is why the new definition of intelligence was being related to the ability to solve cognitive tasks or problems so rather than considering the nature of agents researchers began to study the nature of intelligence itself then the question comes how to test or validate intelligence the best way to test intelligence is to solve cognitive problems an agent can be said intelligent only if it can solve a complex problem the problem-solving approach can be easily tested and validated on computers thus some researchers began studying the ideal intelligence and the selected agent to validate the experiments was the computer so a computer and problem-solving approach were adopted so the human-centered approach and computer problem-solving approach are the two main aims of ai both of these fields have contributed to the field by giving valuable insightsboth the aims are important and both of these collaboratively form the main aim of aimachine learning:in the problem-solving approach there is a big challenge that ai has to overcome in order to achieve its aim consider the example of solving a math problem there are two cases by which intelligence can be tested in this problem-solving approach let us say two math problems are given for you to solve the first problem is familiar to you and the second problem is notconsider the first problem the first problem is familiar to you that means you know how to solve such kind of problems as you have already solved some similar problems in the past so there comes a question how our mind is able to solve that problem the answer is that you have solved similar problems in the past thus you have learned from the past data how to solve such problems thus even if you haven’t seen that problem in the past you will still be able to solve similar problems this is one form of intelligenceconsider another case where you are given a second problem where you have not solved such kind of problems in the past then to solve this problem you will try to consciously gather and manipulate the given information so that you reach a certain conclusion this kind of approach does not necessarily rely on the past data but completely on the reasoning process this is the second kind of intelligencefor ai to build intelligent agents both of these kinds of intelligence must be developed in the agent but the reality is that ai has reached the point where it is able to build agents which can only learn from past data and find some useful information ai today has not reached a point where it can build agents who can think on their own that is the second type of intelligenceso the way ai is able to implement the first type of intelligence is through machine learning so the domain of ai which focuses solely on implementing the first kind of intelligence is in fact machine learning that is the reason why ml is called the subset of ai so this is the main difference between ai and mltechnically speaking “it is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn from past data and find some meaningful conclusions patterns without being explicitly programmed” this statement needs some elaboration the essence of ml is related to the process of “generalization” and learning from past data generalization is an abstraction by which common properties of specific instances are formulated as general concepts or claims consider how we humans recognize daily life objects if we see an animal then we can easily recognize if it is a “dog” or a “cat” it is a very trivial task for us but have you ever wondered how our mind is able to do it the answer is generalizationif you were given a picture of a dog you can easily recognize that it is a picture of a dog because our minds have abstracted the description of a dog and formulated it into a “concept” of what a dog is and these concepts became better and better as we learned from the past experiences of a dog so the way we think is dependent on the fact that things are represented as generalized concepts in our mindswith generalization only can come real “information” so we try to give computers the ability to generalize the “raw data” and convert it into “information” which can be patterns and trends in the data on their ownstatistics:this is the discipline that concerns the collection organization analysis interpretation and presentation of data statistics tries to deal with data with the only aim that is to explain it so it is the study of explaining the data itself statistics has two main domains which are descriptive statistics and inferential statisticsdescriptive statistics deals with the explanation or description of data thus the name “descriptive” statistics it tries to explain as much information as possible easily about the whole large data which would be a very complex task otherwise\\xa0inferential statistics try to make accurate inferences from the available small data we use inference in many tasks in our daily lives consider a simple case of cooking a soup after completing the recipe you will taste a small sample that is a spoonful of the soup to check if the soup tastes good or bad depending upon the result of the sample you make an inference about the whole soup that if the soup as a whole good or bad similarly in statistics there are cases where you have to apply inference to have meaningful information for example consider a case where you cannot gather the whole data because it is very time-consuming and costly in these cases applying inference based on the available sample introduces uncertainty that is where inferential statistics come for helpso\\xa0the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision-making in the face of uncertainty is what statistics deals with so however and whatever the data statistics tries to explain that data this aim does not resonate with that of ai and ml but statistics help these fields to correctly interpret the datadata mining: \\xa0“data” is not useful at all in its raw form consider examples of sensors used in industrial applications these sensors might be used in a manufacturing plant to sense different properties like temperature pressure etc the raw data generated by these sensors are not useful until and unless it is converted to a suitable form then processed analyzed to gather valuable insights which can be used to solve a problemdue to its unique aim of capturing the essence of very large datasets to gather insights data mining is also referred to as “knowledge discovery” that is why carly fiorina former ceo of hewlett-packard once said “the goal is to turn data into information and information into insight” this statement completely explains the aim of data mining\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 so the difference between ai machine learning statistics and data mining lies in their aims but the approaches taken in all of these

medium for a few weeks or even for a year these cultures can be used to test the toxicity and efficacy of substances for example: in eye irritancy tests new animals have to be used in each experiment to check if the substance is irritating the eye or not many animals permanently lose their eyesight and using a new animal every time is just simply inhumane using bovine corneal organ culture in which the corneal tissue is cultured for three weeks before using it yields the same result without any complications scientists have started to use this method to test for toxicity and efficacy in cosmetics drugs and chemical sectors\\xa03-d printing– making complex tissue structures from a single digital file is astonishing printing tissues can help in carrying out experiments on it and getting results similar to the real tissues for example earlier animal organs charts and 3-d models were used to explain the functioning of a particular organ to medical students but now bio-printing companies have started making human tissues and organs which are used by students in various medical schools to understand the intricacies of human organs which has helped in bringing down animal experimentation to a large extentthese bio-printed models can also be used by the researchers to conduct experiments on them without using animals for it a french company is working on a bio-printed liver model to test liver toxicity without having to use animals at all this is a breakthrough in the field of bio-technology as it can bring down animal experimentation by a large percentage\\xa0 \\xa0organ-on-a-chip method\\xa0– it is a fairly new technology which consists of growing cells inside chips where they imitate the structure and behavior of human organs researchers can test drugs on these chips and it is far cheaper and humane than testing on animals for example uk company cn bio has come with a system which consists of 10 organs on a single chip and they have tissues ranging from the liver to the brainmicro dosing: humans can participate in these experiments in which they are injected with small one time doses and are constantly monitored under imaging techniques to gather information on the changes happening in the body these tests can replace certain tests on animals and help in removing drug compounds that don’t have the desired effect on the human body for example covid-19 tests were carried on human volunteers in which they were given small doses of the vaccine and kept under constant surveillance this helped the researchers in removing the drugs that were not having the desired effect on the human body and thus they were also able to remove animal testing as one of the processesthese alternatives can help in bringing down animal experimentation to a large extent if science can progress without harming animals then we should go for it rather than putting them through excruciating pain we must protect the animals as much as we can or else we would soon be living in a world without them\\xa0blackcoffer insights 21: eeshan singh and sowmya k p icfai business school hyderabad',\n",
              " 'introductionthe definition of consciousness has been controversial for centuries hence it is given the title of the ‘most familiar and yet mysterious aspects of our lives’ an idea of this concept would be an awareness in beings of their surroundings themselves and their own perception the reason this part of our mind remains unascertained is that consciousness isn’t observable unlike brain matter that is studied scientifically the physical clarification of awareness is in a general sense incomplete: it doesn’t include what it feels to be the subject for the subject there likewise is by all accounts an unbridgeable illustrative gap between the physical world and our consciousness as suggested by an incident of eastern and shamir traditions consciousness is both universal and primal whilst we have made tremendous progress in understanding brain activity over the years this research hasn’t been able to answer all the questions relating to the nature of emotions and experienceshistorybeginning within the late nineteenth century this was a time that once had psychological queries driven by a philosophical understanding of the mind which was typically equated with consciousness as a result the analysis of brain and behavior naturally thought of the role of consciousness in behavioral management by the brainthe ancient mayans were among the first to propose a sorted out feeling of each degree of consciousness its purpose and its worldly association with mankind since consciousness incorporates stimuli from nature as well as interior stimuli the mayans trusted it to be the most essential type of existence equipped for evolution the incas however thought about consciousness as a movement of mindfulness as well as of worry for others toojohn locke an early philosopher said that consciousness and so individuality are freelanced of all substances he also detected that there is no reason to believe that consciousness is stuck to any specific body or mind or that consciousness cannot be transferred from one body or mind to a different one karl marx another early thinker denies the mind-body classification and holds that consciousness is jeopardized by the material eventualities of one’s settings william james an american psychologist differentiated consciousness to a stream – unbroken and continuous despite several changes and shiftswhile the main center of a lot of the analysis moved to strictly note cable behaviors throughout the primary half of the twentieth century analysis of human consciousness has grown staggeringly after the 1950sin sigmund freud’s psychoanalytic theory we can see that he believed that all three levels of awareness- preconscious conscious and unconscious were responsible for one’s behavior and thinking he believed that the mid itself was divided into three parts- the id the ego and the superego the id is present at birth instinctual and operates according to the pleasure principle the ego underseals reality and logic and develops out of the id in infancy finally the superego is an internalization of society’s moral standards and responsible for guilt now the id is regarded as unconscious whereas the ego and superego are also conscious and preconscious freud constantly revised his own clinical qualities researches however and didn’t conduct scientific experiments and hence his work is heavily scrutinized leaving the questions unanswered\\xa0\\xa0sigmund freud’s theory differed from the other psychologists since his theories were more understandable and very easily conveyed to the people sigmund freud’s work and hypotheses helped people shape their perspectives on youth character memory sexuality and therapy however his theories were subject to considerable criticism both now and during his own life whilst john locke and william james took a more practical approach to the mystery by conducting experiments sigmund freud didn’t provide any evidence to support his claimsbraintoday the essential focal point of consciousness research is on understanding what consciousness implies both biologically and mentally issues of interest include phenomena such as perception blindsight brainwaves during sleep and altered states of consciousness produced by psychoactive drugsa greater part of the test assesses consciousness by approaching human subjects for a verbal report of their encounters however to confirm the criticalness of these verbal reports researchers must contrast them with the action that all the while happens in the brain —that is they should search for the neural connections of consciousnesshope is to locate that noticeable action in a specific aspect of the brain or a particular pattern of global brain activity will be greatly predictive of consciousness mindfulness a few brain imaging strategies for example eeg and mri scans have been utilized for physical proportions of brain activities in these examinationsa few investigations have shown that movement in essential primary sensory areas of the brain isn’t adequate to create consciousness: it is workable for subjects to report an absence of awareness in any event when areas for example the primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions to a stimulus higher brain areas are viewed as all the more encouraging particularly the prefrontal cortex which is involved in a range of high order functionsone mainstream theory implicates various examples of brain waves in creating various conditions of consciousness analysts can record mind waves or drawings of electrical movement inside the cerebrum using an electroencephalograph (eeg) and placing electrodes on the scalp the four types of brain waves (alpha beta theta and delta) each correspond with one mental state (relaxed alert lightly asleep and deeply asleep)memoryepisodic memory can be regarded as the only form of conscious memory this is because it is the capacity to consciously remember personally experienced events and situations in the past the hippocampus located in the brain’s temporal lobe is responsible for this type of memoryconsciousness also plays a part in important memory distinctions one such distinction is the implicit and explicit characteristics; in which explicit memory is what you consciously know and implicit memory includes events you may not be conscious offurthermore several empirical findings suggest that declarative memory is related to consciousness as well; meaning that the retrieval and formation of this memory are connected to awareness working memory operatesmaintains consciously perceived information as well since it temporarily stores and tampers with information whilst working on tasksthe current ways of testing this information are lacking in several essential aspects including spatial resolution temporal resolution or scope examples of such methods are pet fmri eeg implanted electrodes etcpet and fmri have temporal resolution problems eeg is well-known to have localizability difficulties and implanted electrodes whilst great in temporal and spatial resolution can only test a set number of neurons; that is they are restricted in scope hence huge numbers of our speculations while testable on a fundamental level appear to be difficult to test as of nowmental illnessconsciousness has an influence on the way we see objects around us which encourages us to settle on choices about how to communicate with them experiencing difficulty perceiving objects is connected to a few problems for example agnosia (a failure to decipher visual data) alzheimer’s disease and autism however we actually don’t comprehend what visual data is basic for the mind to intentionally perceive an objectseveral different disorders of consciousness include locked-in syndrome minimally conscious state persistent vegetative state chronic coma and brain deathlocked-in syndrome otherwise called pseudo coma is a condition wherein a patient is aware however can’t move or impart verbally because of complete loss of motion of essentially all voluntary muscles in the body aside from vertical eye developments and squinting the individual is conscious and is able to speak with eye movementsin a minimally conscious state the patient has intermittent periods of awareness and wakefulness patients need to give restricted however reproducible indications of consciousness of themself or their current circumstance this could be following straightforward orders comprehensible speech or purposeful conductin a persistent vegetative state the patient has sleep-wake cycles but lacks awareness is not able to communicate and only displays reflexive and non-purposeful behavior the term refers to an organic body that is able to grow and develop devoid of intellectual activity or social intercourselike coma chronic coma results generally from cortical or white-matter harm after neuronal or axonal injury or from central brainstem sores usually the metabolism in the grey matter decreases to 50-70% of the normal range the patient lies with eyes shut and doesn’t know about self or environmental factorsbrain death is the irreversible end of all brain activity and function (including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life) the main cause is total necrosis of the cerebral neurons following loss of brain oxygenation after brain death the patient lacks any sense of awareness; sleep-wake cycles or behavior and typically look as if they are dead or are in a deep sleep statefuture predictions and conclusionas we can see from the history of scholar’s endeavors to study consciousness empirically its nature is not one that can be defined using scientific methods in the past psychologists such as descartes came up with dualistic theories that did not line up with the fundamental laws of physics in the battle between realists and illusionists taking sides is fundamentally impossible as the topic doesn’t allow for concrete evidenceas we can observe from neural examinations of the brain to detect the causes of consciousness there is no sensory sector of the brain that is the cause for one to be aware during a certain event even if there are clear signs of a reaction to a stimulus similarly even though consciousness plays a major role in memory we currently lack the facilities to research it fully in the future there is a possibility that we will be able to access such facilities however which could allow us to find the neural connections and its ties to mental illness as well not only would this help several people by making us aware of the causes of our perspective on certain things but it would also give us a better chance of recognizing signs of possible mental illness or other issues beforehandas it seems researchers continue to study this unknown part of our mind and once we are able to fund and recover from the global pandemic we will be able to answer one of psychology’s most difficult questionsblackcoffer insights 21: amara arora and vaanya kaushal scottish high international school\\xa0',\n",
              " 'nature has blessed humanity with earth a rounded globe where all essential necessity lies in the hand of a human though in this 21st-century building space shuttle and exploring space has become an obvious activity among the human raise now with the inclusion of start-ups like space x once dreamed for reaching out at space now is coming true we all have to agree upon a fact that in the growth of industrialization we have generated a humungous carbon footprint and colonize at outer space will create a much-needed area for our survivalwith time the human race has visualized and has undergone many transformations and these transformations may for starters were not that effective but were a major role at existence to this age be it a natural transformation like shifting of tectonic plates or manmade like dumping water and damaging water bodies somehow have affected usual life of humans so creating space of humans is what next humans are eyeing forall this idea for colonizing in outer space emerged when nasa was able to launch a space shuttle with a heavy payload in the late 1990s this idea didn’t stir brain at that time but later was like apple eyes when various articles from astronauts and their writeup came into limelight and this idea saw its progression space exploration was not a new normal companies were petrified by the number of investments that these kinds of projects ask for but things change with the entry of paypal’s owner elon musk in 2002 where he laid stones of space x with nasa providing the launchpad for their explorationbeing space travel legitimate there where many bottlenecks knowing the nature of outer space will boost the idea of colonizing here one has to realize the optimum but the main target that these company put forward with themself was to not just get into other planet but to get back at earth safely earlier these projects due to high fund was always subdued and priority was given to the rocket technology thus this unimaginable quest for the search of space was far-fetched thoughnow being in 2020 we do not find it out of a place of colonizing outside of space the kind of emergence of technologies has led to the escalation of spreading the roots of human existence the plan for reaching out to outer space too plays a key role for this idea too proper planning analysing organising and executing were required for these projects to be successful for deeper know how i would like to mention here an example of space x according to them they wud be successful for sending rockets by 2022 and would able to colonize by 2050 for achieving these vision they have planned a total of 36 times pre-launch of the same rocket which they will be launching by 2020 not only that they have already placed their star link satellites which will provide the basic network connectivity for their colonized world they have planned this to that extent that they have targeted a profit of $ 22 billion yearly by 2025 already they have sent the first manned rocket successfully what elon musk plan is to create that infrastructure by which going to mars with cost as a regular air flight ticket all this will lead to better chances for colonizing at another planet with setting up their commercial flight once started to the red planet it wud just be a stepping stone for the colonizing at the outer spacebut the fundamental change that people have to undergo while living on another planet will be a change in gravity and being able to be near to live support if any technical issues arise to their suit until unless we find a similar place like the earth that is the change which humans have to adjust aspects like ultraviolet rays too will play an immense role in the survival but with the rate of technology expanding and challenging at very boundaries there are not many days left when we find solutions to these aspects but this idea of colonizing has more to do with monetary terms it has been projected that building a colony at space will cost at about $10 trillian which is more than many countries gdp placing that much of an amount and getting funding for such highly anticipated projects is tough elon to have addressed with these questions with an open door he believes that this cost is nothing when we find a route to colonize space and these costs will be justifiable when space exploration will reach new heightsalso our world is around water and the percentage of land comparison to water is too less whereas the population is increasing with the speed and the level of excitement in order to search for new things and the obsession with the new and innovative things never going to finish because in the end we do not satisfy what we have achieved we are only looking for other things and crave to achieve thatin order to achieve that planning is most crucial stage as of now we have searched 9 planets but still didn’t shortlisted the outcomes but according to the 3-decade theory of elon musk it seems to be possibleas the most important thing to survive is the atmospheric environment whether is this suitable or not and in order to make it suitable what steps had to take and maintain the suitable level of oxygen\\xa0 the missions are now what everyone is focusing about finding the source of water because its 2nd crucial thing which is needed to surviveapart from the excitement and the things the threats or the uncertainties are bound to happen like any kind of mammal which could occur during construction or after that so the security for that or any protection so that uncertainties could be replicatedafter the basic things other factors like what are the natural habitats available there whether the plants could be grown over there or not if yes then what types of plants could survive therethe environment for the animals is safe or not because to balance the nature we need all types of animals natural habitat even insects and other small things which seems to be ignorable but plays an important role in maintaining the environmental balance for eg\\xa0 – ants are among the leading predators of other insects helping to keep pest populations low\\xa0 ants move approximately the same amount of soil as earthworms loosening the soil in the process and increasing air and water movement into the ground\\xa0 they keep the ecosystem clean of dead insect carcasses and aid in the destruction and decomposition of plant and animal matter\\xa0so every small thing contributes in its own wayanother matter of concern is the level of artificial intelligence and machine learning required to maintain that kind of requirement because as the current scenario we need energy to run any vehicle or even for the robotics so the availability of the energy and the source of energy is neededand apart from this the heat of sun is equally important in order to maintain the level because with artificial air we can survive but not for so long so in order to remain healthy as well the calculation has to be done when thinking about disease you may have heard in the news about the concern that antibiotics (such as penicillin) – which help fight infections – may eventually stop working global health organisations are trying to reduce the use of antibiotics especially for conditions that aren’t serious this is because their overuse in recent years means that they’re becoming less effectivebut still we can survive without antibiotics because there are ways\\xa0of dealing with diseases caused by bacteria such as isolation which is how they were treated before penicillinit might sound like something set firmly in the realm of fantasy but experts in private industry and governments around the world are trying to understand how feasible it would be to establish a lunar base some scientists think humans could survive comfortably on the moon in some ways the very minimal gravity of the moon might actually be more conducive to life than the microgravity astronauts experience on the international space stationalthough it hasn’t been formally tested some experts hypothesize that the small amount of gravitational force put on an astronaut’s body when on the moon\\xa0could help stem some of the adverse effects like bone-density and muscle loss that space flyers experience while living in microgravity on the international space stationby using the moon’s indigenous material space agencies can save money on the cost of flying pricey missions to and from the moon’s surface\\xa0once on the moon instead of having to stage costly missions aimed at delivering oxygen and other necessary resources from earth experts might be able to actually use the material to manufacture gasses needed to sustain life on the satelliteon earth we are protected from radioactive solar winds and cosmic rays by our own magnet field known as the magnetosphere but out in the space we can’t rely on this type of protection and in order to make that protection it could take a lot but yes with more upgraded technology it could achievealthough till now the approximate value of the project is $10 trillion but the aim is to make the fare equivalent to the normal air fareas once we are comfortable with all the resources securities for uncertainties risk analysis and the probability of survival of the human being and many other factors after consideration then development won’t take much timebecause to construct a building it take normally 8-9 months which is totally acceptablebut the main concern is the density of the land ie whether the land has the capacity to bear that much weight or not and the type of land is adaptable for cultivation or nor although land can be converted into different types of cultivation but with the help of upgraded technologyin order to transport the equipments on the regular basis a large amount of fuel is required and other factors as well and built the propellor depo for rocket landing building various infrastructure for the city one by one will create a way forward for idea of colonizing at outer spaceblackcoffer insights 21: anubhav sassendran and shivay agarwal new delhi institute of

trait theories the big 5 personality trait theory is always linked closely with leadership as per the various researches the personality traits of extraversion openness and conscientiousness are associated with leaders more often than the other two traits not just these humble and empathetic are also considered as the adjectives that are frequently associated with leaders but nowhere is technical expertise related to a leader #notsotechnicalas stated by colin powell leadership is the art of accomplishing more than the science of management says is possible #it’sart if leadership is an art and leaders are the artists then more or less the leaders can be viewed as directors of the films who are organizing arranging managing and directing the scenes another analogy for that can be the orchestra where the conductor is using the batonstick to set the rhythm of the band so is it necessary for the conductor to himself or herself by a great violinist no when it comes to the corporate sector the leader need not be an expert on the technology but should know how the technology functions so that heshe can utilize it in the best possible way they can allocate the task of building technology to the right technical experts and how do the leaders identify the right person for that job or how do leaders know what qualities to look for in a person #experience every great

fields their visionary outlook their management skills and the experience they gathered helped them in achieving their targets leaders can always take the assistance of the subject matter experts to guide them in situations of technical difficulties as per the great man situational and trait theory of leadership leadership is innate to the person leadership though can be conditioned or can be brought out in a person by rewarding him great leaders show unconditional attachment towards their vision everyone knows how to read a map but which path to choose isn’t something that can be taught leaders give the direction or vision to the company and drive it closer to the target that the company wants to achieve leadership theories don’t focus on the technical knowledge of the leaders but rather more on people skills their approach towards a problem and how well they guide and hire others to get the job done which is also evident as per the managerial skills required as per robert katzthough it can be argued that technical experts are also the great leaders in their areas but these leaders are generally at the middle management level as per the different leadership styles a servant leader is the one who always tries to achieve the goal of the team these leaders are the ones who have a management objective laid out in front of them and they drive the team closer to achieving the target by having the people-first mindset a collaborative approach towards solving the problem these are the people or the leaders needed at the execution level of the project or those who are too close to the employees at the bottom-most level since the managers at the top of the pyramid don’t get much time to invest in people they appoint the right people on their behalf to get the job done \\xa0consider an it firm so as per the points mentioned above does it mean that a leader or the manager shouldn’t know how to code depends if the person is the first line manager then he or she should probably know how to code so that he or she can help the team in achieving the target of producing less garbage which might be one of the project’s kpis the project manager who might be an operations manager (#mba) from an it background probably need not know what line of code is to be written but should know the algorithms or the logic behind the code so that he or she can validate the code from the client’s perspective the ceo might not be from an it background but should know how to run an it firm rather than the syntax of the codebut in today’s competitive world leaders can’t be one dimensional they need to have expertise in multiple areas to be at the top mike brearley if got a chance to play a t20 match won’t even get picked into aside not because of his age but because of his not so great looking batting statistics(#thegamehaschanged) his leadership skills won’t be enough to get him into the squad but he can be a great leader if selected to coach the top 15 captains in the world today as we have already discussed the film directors their job isn’t to teach the cameramen on how to set up or operate (lens settings etc) the camera their job is to guide the cameramen on what angle it should be held and how he or she should coordinate with the lights crew so that a perfect shot is captured so even if a leader may not be a technical expert of his field but if he or she has the right approach and mindset understands the system and its process then he or she can hire the best talent for the job and can get the work done by guiding the talent with his or her visionso the answer to the question which we came across in the first paragraph is yes and no depending upon the position in the hierarchy (yes for a front-line manager and no for a cxo) and the type of the leader you are the level of technical expertise needed varies though as stated earlier by robert katz the cxo’s need to have the least amount of technical expertise the cxo should know how the technology functions or what are the applications what processes are to be followed to build the technology \\xa0he or she should now what is to be done rather than how it is to be done (#itsnothowitswhat) otherwise even though the company might be sitting on a gold mine but if the leader isn’t aware of that or isn’t learned enough to know what to do with it no company can succeed even with having all the resources at their disposal leaders command respect and don’t demand it and that’s possible when they give value to their front-line employees seek timely advice from the technical experts and put the resources to the best of its uses otherwise you will be surrounded by technical experts like dilberts (#dilbert)blackcoffer insights 20: rohan mehta symbiosis institute

              " 'the word “leadership” can bring to mind a variety of images for example a political leader pursuing a passionate personal cause or an executive developing hisher company’s strategy to beat the competition leaders help themselves and others to do the right things they set direction build an inspiring vision and create something new leadership is about mapping out where you need to go to “win” as a team or an organization; and it is dynamic exciting and inspiringin my point of view we cannot become a good leader without technical expertise because every task in the organization it’s required a lot of skills knowledge consistent enthusiastic patience motivating inspiring industrious and critical thinking on the basis of the field we are doing a leader should have the ability to motivate self and others effective oral and written communication critical thinking skills at the working team and delegating a task good leaders do have these abilities and if we wanted to create a future leader they need to take in a large volume of information and to take the essential elements that define the core problem to solve they need to organize a team to solve these problems and to communicate to a group they need to established trust with a group and use the trust to allow the team to accomplish the work more than it could be done alone though all these skills we have but it’s would not sufficient to make us a great leader because to excel and utilize these abilities in practice we need a lot of technical expertise in a particular domain for example like in a hospital if the head of the hospital is lead by other people rather than doctor then the hospital would become worse at a point because the person from other fields he could not lead and understand the real scenario and mechanism that the hospital is functioning and he would not understand the staff and the patient as well hence to lead the hospital doctor is deserved who knows his own field how to lead and understand the real scenario of it that’s why being a leader requires technical expertise to have great knowledge and understanding about his own organization every person if they want to become a leader they should have technical expertise on their own organization so that their organization would run smoothly hence nobody could run other organization if we do not have the technical expertise on that fieldso be a leader not a boss which makes your life much better as they’re a saying that “ a good objective of leadership is to help those who are doing poorly to do well and to help those who are doing well to do even better”blackcoffer insights 20: caldinus nongrang nit meghalaya',\n",
              " 'when we talk about ai different people have different perspectives about it there is one group of people having good knowledge about the real potential of ai who believe that ai can be a novel solution to many problems that the world is facing today there is another group of people who are merely threatened by the thought of ai taking over the worldthe field of ai took birth when alan turing in 1950 had this thought “can machines think” later in the 1980s with the adoption of “expert systems” by the companies around the world the booming of the field of ai was initiated initially it was a matter of awe for everyone to see the results of what ai can achieve ai’s growth in the past few decades has been exponential and it has transformed the way we live work and solve challenges ai has made its impact in a wide variety of areas including healthcare education business and many more but one of the areas of highest impact that ai has made recently is in the environment and climate changeis ai revolutionizing the way we deal with environment and climate changeai can strengthen climate predictions enable smarter decision-making for decarbonising industries from building to transport and work out how to allocate renewable energy in recent years ai has been a game-changer in how many people as well as organizations deal with climate change microsoft believes that artificial intelligence often encompassing machine learning and deep learning is a “game-changer” for climate change and environmental issues the company’s ‘ai for earth’ program has committed $50 million over five years to create and test new applications for aiai is increasingly used to manage the intermittency of renewable energy so that more can be incorporated into the grid; it can handle power fluctuations and improve energy storage as well wind companies are using ai to get each turbine’s propeller to produce more electricity per rotation by incorporating real-time weather and operational dataai can also improve energy efficiency on the city scale by incorporating data from smart meters and the internet of things (the internet of computing devices that are embedded in everyday objects enabling them to send and receive data) to forecast energy demand besides artificial intelligence systems can simulate potential zoning laws building ordinances and flood plains to help with urban planning and disaster preparedness one vision for a sustainable city is to create an “urban dashboard” consisting of real-time data on energy and water use and availability traffic and weather to make cities more energy-efficient and livablehotter temperatures will have significant impacts on agriculture as well data from sensors in the field that monitor crop moisture soil composition and temperature help ai improve production and know when crops need watering incorporating this information with that from drones which are also used to monitor conditions can help increasingly automatic ai systems know the best times to plant spray and harvest crops and when to head off diseases and other problems this will result in increased efficiency enhanced yields and lower use of water fertilizer and pesticidesbut is ai as good as it looks or does it have a downsidewhen we talk about the effect of ai in the environment and climate both sides of the coin must be elucidated so apart from all the positives discussed above the usage of ai also has a downsidelast year’s world economic forum report showed that while ai can address some of earth’s environmental challenges it is important to manage it properly according to the forum and experts in the field ai has the potential to accelerate environmental degradation the use of power-intensive gpus to run machine learning training has already been cited as contributing to increased c02 emissionsalthough ai has been around for about half a century the question of environmental impact – and other ethical issues – is only arising now because the techniques developed over decades can now be used in combination with an explosion in data and strong computational powerfor all the advances enabled by artificial intelligence from speech recognition to self-driving cars ai systems consume a lot of power and can generate high volumes of climate-changing carbon emissionsa study last year found that training an off-the-shelf ai language-processing system produced 1400 pounds of emissions – about the amount produced by flying one person roundtrip between new york and san francisco but there are ways to make machine learning cleaner and greener a movement that has been called “green ai” some algorithms are less power-hungry than others for example and many training sessions can be moved to remote locations that get most of their power from renewable sourcesthe key however is for ai developers and companies to know how much their machine learning experiments are spewing and how much those volumes could be reducedwhat can be doneto prevent this the proposition by the world economic forum report is that advancements in “safe” ai should be pursued to ensure that humanity is not developing ai that is harmful to the environment specifically the world economic forum said in its report that ai developers “must incorporate the health of the natural environment as a fundamental dimension” this means safeguarding against models that will demand the consumption of energy or natural resources beyond what is sustainable among other factors in a sense all programs need to be designed with the dimension of environmental protection and improvement in mindin the future development of ai programs it will also be important to note the environmental impact of creating these systems in the first place according to an academic study on energy usage for deep learning processes the creation of an effective ai might be costly to the environment nearly 300000 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions are created during the process of training a single model this is basically equal to the emissions of five average cars in the united states considering the negative environmental impact in addition to the positive implications of ai and climate change will be crucial moving forwardthere is always room for improvement some pioneers of machine learning recently published a paper called tackling climate change with machine learning was discussed at a major ai conference david rolnick a postdoctoral fellow of the university of pennsylvania said “call to arms” which means to bring researchers togetherthis paper covers thirteen areas of research where machine learning can be used including energy production co2 removal education solar geoengineering finance and many more the main idea is to build more energy-efficient buildings creating new low-carbon materials high tech monitoring of deforestation and greener transportation sources artificial

track the emission google is expanding its horizon of nonprofit’s satellite imagery including gas-powered plants emissions which can be used by researchers to track the pollution there are countries organizations which govern co2 emission on the ground level but these data are unreachable by global monitoring associationsai can automate the analysis of images of power plants to get regular

he learns from youtube vinay took his carpentry lessons during engineering so he has a practical idea of how to make a stool but sameer is a carpenter so he has a total understanding of the material process and final productlet us start with manish understand that the task is to get their jobs done manish has two options here he can either order parts and assemble it himself or order the material required such as wood glue nails etc and then work on it before the assembly of the final product the only difference is his lack of expertise in this fieldvinay has the same options but has practical experience from his carpentry classes during the workshop in engineering sameer has an advantage since he has both skill and experience perfected over a course of timeall three are given three days for the task since manish finds it easy to assemble the stool using parts procured from another carpenter; he talks to a carpenter he knows and orders 3 leg parts 6 horizontal support bars and one circular base which will sit on the top vinay thinks he will be able to shape the parts because of his experience as a student and orders several cylindrical wooden leg parts cuboidal bars and a thick sheet sameer has all the required material in his shop and he begins to work on the stool on the first daymanish and vinay wait for a day for the parts to come they begin to work on the second day manish uses the tricks learned from youtube videos; uses a hammer to place the nails purchased from a nearby shop in the pre-made hole applies glue in certain areas as directed in the video and places weight on the assembled stool he waits for the glue to curevinay uses borrowed drill bits drill machines cutters sandpapers purchased from a shop etc and starts working on the wooden parts as soon as the parts arrive in the morning he is able to recall his carpentry instructions and attempts to shape the parts based on drawing of his product he made last night sameer meanwhile has completed his assembly and has put the assembly to rest for the glue to cureon the third day each of them has the stool ready they evaluate their own work and notice certain factsmanish notices that he did complete the task but his stool was wobbly and not glued well it could fall the moment he sits on it also he forgets to polish the wooden parts and give it a professional finish since he forgot to watch that bit of video over youtubevinay completes the task his stool is sturdy and cured well overnight but there are minor issues with it one of the three legs is cut short by a few mm and the stool a tad unstablesameer on the other hand completes the task with a good product the stool is well-balanced and polished as he expected from him sameer is satisfied with his work and finds it to stool perfect manish thinks he did his best considering he had no experience of the task to be done he is satisfied with his work but vinay is unhappy he could have done better and made the product better he doesn’t find his efforts well put and thinks he wasn’t productive enough and hence his stool is nowhere perfectunderstand that all of them had a set of skills and experience but only sameer had the right skills and experience to produce a perfect product manish and sameer were satisfied and happy with their work manish made a wobbly stool which could break the moment someone sat on it but happy he gave the task a go he thinks put the efforts and he did a good job it was only vinay who could not overcome the fact that his work was not perfectin vinay’s case it can be observed that he could not deliver what he learned from carpentry classes the reason is simple he put effort but didn’t have the experience experience mattered since vinay thinks otherwise he believes he has the perfect skills to complete the task but he could not deliver the results he is not satisfied with his results and wishes to spend another day working on the stool on his own to get to his idea of the perfect resultin this case the idea of perfection itself is misplaced you see the end product made by vinay and manish would not match sameer’s but the task could have been completed had they understood where their shortcomings lied for both it was their skill sameer had the perfect skill to get the expected result which resulted in better productivity others didn’tand in this story every individual put effort regardless of the result but some were satisfied and some dissatisfied their satisfaction made their creations perfect in their eyes and dissatisfaction made one believe he wasn’t productive enough \\xa0“perfection is subjective and productivity is utility extracted given a certain amount of effort”you can try to be as productive to achieve something but ultimately it’s the satisfaction you get that defines the boundary of perfection if you aren’t satisfied you won’t find anything perfect you would just waste both your time and effort over something that doesn’t suit you in the first place as explained in the story before“it isn’t productivity that will be the greatest enemy but your satisfaction”satisfaction will determine how you perceive perfection and defines where your threshold for perfection lies the real enemy is dissatisfaction you get demotivated and restless you lose sight and discontinue only because you are unable to pass your own expectation so it’s the only obstacle that comes in between productivity from time to timeproductivity is far from being your enemy the greatest enemy will be your expectations which lead to dissatisfaction it will play a major role in crafting your idea of perfection in every dayblackcoffer insights 19: jude francis institute of management technology (imt) nagpur',\n",

the repayment schedule or in simple terms loans were given out to people without proper checks and low credit scores) which ultimately led onto a huge global collapsethe financial crisis of 2008 or great recession is considered the worst economic crisis since the great depressionfinancial crisis explained –in the year 1996 there was a dot-com boom (or otherwise known as the dot com bubble) in the united states a period of massive growth in the use of the internet because of which the stock market prices started increasing rapidly however around the year 2000 it dropped which led people and investors to withdraw their investments from the stock market rapidly it led to the decline of the price of shares in stock markets and the interest rate plummeted to around 1% very quickly in a short spaninvestors were now looking for a brighter option than investing in stock markets fig – rise and fall of the dot com bubbleas interest rates went lower and lower real estate prices started rising and the us govt also encouraged people to buy houses and properties the demand for the same started rising rapidly and investors now found a great option to invest in (ie in real estate)during that same time investment banks saw an opportunity chimed in and started buying loans from banks in bulk and clubbed multiple loans under a complex derivative called cdo (collateralized debt obligations) and started providing it to these investors after getting a credit rating of “aaa” (very safe investment) from the credit rating agencies investors naturally fell for it and started buying these cdosso now the risk factor of these loans got transferred from the banks to the investment banks and then again to the cdo investorswith the high buying demand of cdos investment banks started demanding or pressurizing banks to provide even more loans so that they can provide more cdos to the investors however banks had already provided loans to people with good credit history and regular income people but in the hope of getting even more credit from investment banks these same banks then started giving out subprime housing loans to people with low credit scoresapproximately $174bn worth of loans were given out during the period 2000-2007 and most of them were clubbed as cdos with a “aaa” rating from the credit rating agencies approximately 70% of these cdo’s were marked with a “aaa” ratinginvestment banks and credit rating agencies were now enjoying large profits during this time moody’s (a credit rating agency) profits increased 4x times during that period (2000-2007)looking at the huge profits being made by the investment banks and credit rating agencies insurance companies (like aig) now started giving out insurance on these cdos to the investors and they called it cds (credit default swap) aig believed that since the cdos were rated as “aaa” (very safe investment) the failure chances of these cdos were very minimal they misjudged or were unaware of the fact that some of the loans that were clubbed under these cdos were sub prime loansnow cdo investors started buying out cds from aig and other companies to safeguard and protect them from any losses aig then started making huge profits because of the premiums that the investors had to pay but they never realized the outcome if by any chance the cdos fail at some point in time thus the risk factor again got transferred from the cdo investors to the insurance companiesfig – flow diagram showing how the risk factors got transferredcoming to the loan borrowers now sub prime borrowers from banks were unaware of the fact of adjustable rate loans (interest rate of these loans keeps changing) and thus had to pay lower interests at the start but more interest rates later onthe borrowers started defaulting on these loans when the interest rates increased dramatically around 2007 and thus banks had to then resell those houses to make up for the loans defaulted\\xa0 added to the problem was the fact that borrowers were not spending any amount of money from their pockets while taking loans and banks were providing the full amount of loans almost 50% of the borrowers did not pay anything from their own pocket and bought the home only using the housing loanthis led to a huge increase in the defaulters of borrowers and ultimately banks had to auction houses to gain credit back with the high-interest rates and no one to buy the auctioned houses this ultimately caused a chain reaction and banks were no longer receiving credit the prices of real estate started falling drastically and people with good credit scores who had earlier taken housing loans also started defaulting because the price of their houseshomes fell below the loan amount that they had taken earlier banks stopped receiving money and also because of this chain reaction the value of cdos ultimately came down to 0some investors went for huge losses and few investment companies went bankrupt (ex – lehman brothers) moreover insurance companies had to pay back those investors who had taken insurance as a result some of the insurance companies also went bankrupt aig too almost lost about $100bn in paying back the investors who had earlier insured their cdos however the us govt finally decided to bail out aig in order to save them from going bankruptcdos and cdss were not regulated during that time by the federal reserve and thus this whole situation ultimately led to credit crunch (became very difficult to get loans) and the whole economy of the us underwent a crisis that led to a global impact all around the world unemployment increased manifold and many new businesses had to shut down global trades all around the world also saw a crisis and finally global recession hit the worldcauses of the crisis –improper screening of loan borrowers resulting in subprime loan borrowers which included even borrowers with no stable incomecredit rating agencies rated all the cdos highly and investors were purchasing without proper monitoring the same goes for insurance companieslax regulation of cdos and cds’ by federal reserve banksthe large size of interbank lending that compounded

career people tend to choose a job role that gives them higher social belongingness eg we see more women(as compared to men) in nursing careers as it requires more feminine qualitiesthere are different versions of this perception: which we can see either in the society(in terms of socially assigned gender roles) or in the workplace(in the form of gender discrimination stereotypical thinking sexism etc) eg as per their assigned roles in society women are most likely to take care of their family and children and this affects their income and career growth the motherhood penalty is a term defined by sociologists which states about the inverse correlation between income level and the number of children ie there is also an income difference between a mother and a non-mother employee as per oecd data(2012) there is a 7% reduction in wages for women per childlack of economic opportunities: even in the tech industry women are paid less than men as per ilo data(2019) on average women are paid 20% less than men worldwideeven when it comes to promotion men are preferred more it is to be noted that the numbers are even worse when there is intersectionality involved eg a transgender woman will be paid less than a white woman and so on as per the national centre for transgender equality one out of two transgender people faces adverse effects: including 23% were denied a promotion 44% were passed over for a particular job position and 26% are fired from their workplace just because they are transgenderways to improve gender diversity:we can improve this scenario from the perspective of different stakeholders who are involvedfor society :creating tech awareness from school level: as per the hdr report( 2017) no of boys pursuing stem program is 97% higher than girls one way to improve this is to introduce more strong role models to advocate for this issue minority gender communities should be aware of the multiple job opportunities and career growth available in this field these job roles are not even gender-specific anymore for developing countries like india stem scholarship programs can be introduced from the secondary education leveladdress biasstereotypes: it is to be noted that perceptions stereotypes and biases are not just something we learn in school but our upbringing also creates these the things we watch listen and read daily so it also becomes the duty of the society to create a more inclusive environment eg a more privileged person should fight for the fundamental right of the less empowered or less privileged person in societythere should be active encouragement from parents teachers and educators for students in stem programs regardless of their gender identityfor companies:to promote gender diversity in the workplace companies need to focus on three things:unbiased recruitment policies:generally there is a lot of unconscious bias and prejudices when hiring women trans intersex and queer individuals there needs to be a diversity and inclusivity team in the hr itself that addresses these issues a blind recruitment drive can be conducted where there is no need to mention gender in any of the documentshaving structured questions during the interview might help to remove any unconscious biasesdiversity sensitivity training: workplace policies need to create a company image that hires everyone irrespective of their gender identity and can even keep it optional in all the job formalities and documentsconducting proper sensitivity training to employees is essential as they need to use correct pronoungender-neutral languagenot just sensitivity training strong workplace policies need to be in place which deal with any form of harassment or gender discrimination\\xa0to create accountability and transparency in their process companies can also share diversity and inclusivity company dataretention policies:creating mentorship models:have a mentorship program in the workplace that advocates for women trans intersex and non-binary individuals as leaders and encourages role models within this communityneed to promote diversity in the workplace via proper workplace policies and legal guidelines(eg conducting mandatory sensitization training for all employees or framing zero-tolerance policies)including proper maternity leaves child care facilities and flexibility of working hoursremote working arrangements can be helpful for minority gender in keeping their work-life balancedevelop support programs for these communities who are joining after maternity leave it might be in terms of psychiatric or mentorship supportincrease pay parities: it can be done in the following ways:create flexibility in job roles so that women can move on to higher positionsbuild an inclusive workplace that supports pay parity— no salary difference based on gender for the same job rolescreate a transparent performance review process and ensure that there are no unconscious biases during the recruitment processdoing a pay review within the organization to check how much pay difference exists before making framing policieslastly there needs to be proper government policies in place which provide a constitutional or legal framework starting from the basic education level it may begin from increasing the gross enrollment rates of all students in schools (irrespective of their gender identity) for developing countries( like india) to have proper compensation policies in the workplace(as similar to what states like california new york has adopted) to ensure pay parityblackcoffer insights 19: sushmitha & sujatha iim kozhikode\\xa0',\n",

loud helps diffuse them it’s like turning the light on in a dark room next comes accepting reality for example “i understand that people will not always behave in ideal ways” list off every truth you need to accept then comes acting your values let’s say one of your highest values is conscientiousness how might that value apply in this situation for example it might involve making sure your employees all have masks that fit them well or feel comfortable airing any grievances they have identify your five most important values related to decision-making in a crisis then ask yourself how

relying on reliable what are the limitations of it how do your systems help prevent groupthink what procedures do you have in place to help you see your blind spots how do you ensure that you hear

aperture it can help you see your greatest fears in the broader context of all the other threats out there this can help you get a better perspective on what you fear the mostit might seem illogical that you could reduce your fear of making a mistake by thinking about other negative outcomes but this strategy can help kick you into problem-solving mode and lessen the mental grip a particular fear has on you a leader might be so highly focused on minimizing or optimizing for one particular thing they don’t realize that other people care most about something else find out what other people’s

fear with extreme hypervigilance they want to be on guard at their command post at all times this might manifest as behavior like staying up all night to workthat type of adrenalin-fueled behavior can have short-term value but it can also be myopic a different approach can be more useful for bigger picture thinking we need leisure (and sleep) to step back integrate the threads of our thinking see

noise\\xa0as mentioned when people are fearful they can go into always-on monitoring mode you may have the urge to constantly look at what everyone else is doing to always be on social media or check data too frequently this can result in information overload your mind can become so overwhelmed that you start to feel cloudy or shut down recognize if you’re doing this and limit over-monitoring or overchecking avoid panicked frenzied behavioron its own being afraid of making mistakes doesn’t make you more or less likely to make good decisions if you worry excessively in a way that focuses only

business was left insulated from its effect small businesses were one of the most affected as they rely on day to day sales and keep the inventory minimum based on the demand of customers and have a low margin to maneuverin an article by hsbc’s navigator which described the preparedness and contingency plan for the future indian business rated high among its peers the businesses in india have shown resilience to face adversity which can be attributed to varying degrees of adjustment and adaptability the businesses while able to adhere to government guidelines have managed to facilitate their customers efficiently and effectively however the impact on micro small and medium enterprises cannot be left unattended\\xa0the indian subcontinent has an estimated ₹ 63388 lakh of msme out of which 512% are in rural areas which employ 4484% of the total employment provided by this sector the msme sector with 1170 lakh people constitutes 40% of the total workforce as per the ministry of commerce msme contribution in gross domestic product (gdp) and export are 37% and 43% respectivelywith the huge contribution toward gdp as well as export the impact on the national economy due to the shock in the msme sector from the pandemic will be equally devastating while different businesses face different types of obstacles we have pointed out 8 of the most common issues faced by themlow working capital -: small businesses usually have a low working capital ratio which means that they don’t have enough capital to finance their daily requirements in these difficult times this problem has gone to the next level as they will have obligations to pay but due to less or no revenue for a few months there are high chances that they may not be able to meet themlow cash cycle -: according to a survey done by economic times they have found that small businesses usually run on a 27 days cash cycle and due to pandemic looming around they are not able to operate efficiently more than half of the small businesses of the country have either exhausted their funds or are close to doing so it is because of the unprecedented demand crash due to lockdown\\xa0not registered -: many of the small businesses in india are not registered as they are just too small and this invisibility is both an advantage and disadvantage for them being out of the formal system they don’t have to maintain proper books of accounts pay the taxes and follow all the regulatory norms but the downside of this is that it is difficult for them to access government programs focused on them and make use of itdifficult to get financial support -: it becomes a huge task for small businesses when it comes to getting loans this is because they don’t have proper accounts and assets which they can keep as mortgage to get loans from banks due to this they have to use a traditional method of lending which involves a high rate of interest and during these times it is also getting difficult to get loans from this areaexistential crisis: – with the abrupt change in the business environment the businesses either have low production or they cease to exist while low production will put a burden on the owner’s pocket but if they closed their business and start fresh the cost of starting a new business post-crisis will be high and with limited creditworthiness which makes business\\xa0difficult to regain their lost market share\\xa0migration -: in the starting days of lockdown small businesses were not able to pay their workers which led to migration as they moved back to their hometowns this has led to a problem of the availability of a suitable workforce for these\\xa0businesses as they are trying to get things back to normal\\xa0absence of skills required -: as hiring of new workers is done to get things to normal it is getting difficult for them to provide them with suitable skills needed for some particular jobs and also the existing workforce is not trained enough to cope with the new normal of working onlinecreditworthiness: –\\xa0it is defined as the extent to which a company considered suitable to receive financial credit often based on the reliability in the paying money in the past as businesses are dependent upon the line of credit and the supply chain if it gets hampered it will result in the loss of revenue as well as reputationfor any business cash in hand is oxygen the small business which usually has at most 1-month cash to run the business if the revenue stream dries up which in this tough time has to improve gradually to manage the optimal cash balance is the key to success in this tough time the optimal cash balance here defined as “the less of\\xa0the amount of cash outflow in form\\xa0rent employee salaries and raw material without postponing the payable as they are doing what banks have to do to the inflow from sale”\\xa0cash conversion cycle -: it refers to how fast cash moves through the business in these times when a lot of businesses are switching to online platforms they should think of improving the cash cycle maybe by making changes in the sales cycle reducing inventory in hand and improving upon debtor’s turnover ratio and cash collection periodprioritize the products – the owner of the business should do an analysis of all the products and services it offers and ranks them on the basis of profitability they should focus more on the most profitable product and remove the least profitable product from their portfoliolabour productivity – while it is difficult to manage the business with the current scenario if any business manages to do so they can have a huge advantage over others the productivity of the employee defined as the unit output produced by per employee while firing underperforming employees reduce the salary expense but variable performance-based compensation will strive them to increase productivitygetting new skills – there are many online platforms available from which existing employees can be provided with new skills at a very lower cost this can also give them an advantage in the future if the investment is strategically\\xa0donetapping the resources provided by the government and other financial institutions -: the government of india has launched a rescue plan for small businesses through which they can get loans in a much easier way compared to before it increased the upper limit of the outstanding loan amount from ₹ 25 crores to ₹ 50 crores some financial institutions also launched schemes like covid-19 start-up assistance scheme (‘csas’) by sidbi rbi enhancing the limit for loans to 90% from 75% etcmaking a 3-month financial plan – small business owners should make a different financial plan for the next 3 months and focus on the areas where cost can be cut like delaying payments of rent if possible it should majorly focus on what costs are necessary and which cost can be put on hold for some timetapping the newly available opportunities -: it is a very good opportunity to capitalize on the available resources and encash the different opportunities which have arisen due to this scenario like demand for sanitizers masks more online

layer of\\xa0challenge this challenge will test management skills in various aspects of our business owner\\xa0with this article we have pointed out the major challenges and possible ways to alleviate the impact as anthony robbins quotes “every problem is a gift—without problems we would not grow” the current market has wiped out their share in the market which gives an opportunity to other businesses to grow and lower the expensewhile there may be many facets that need to be handled precisely communication is one of the major tools that will create a positive environment among workers or teams which will influence the customer behavior and result in terms of revenue the communication will also help to increase productivity and create trust in a supply chain which will improve the cash conversion cycles and working capital ratiomarketing through word of mouth has no added cost but the benefit can be scaled too much-required revenue the choice of an effective\\xa0marketing tool can also influence our target customer and will influence their will to buy the product or service(s) strategicallycash from operating activity improves if we were able to lower our expenses to lower these expenses small business owners have to create a different plan (good average and worst) keeping the 6-month frame in mind breaking down them in monthly targets would further help them to

              " 'the covid-19 pandemic has grown into one of the most major and socially disruptive health crises in recent memory with growing worried about how the pandemic’s catastrophic economic and social repercussions are affecting food systems at both the global and local levels given the importance of the retail food environment in establishing and sustaining healthy diets interruptions to specific aspects of it such as the availability of fresh vegetables could have a negative influence on population health which has already been noted as a source of worrydespite the dominance of national and international supermarket chains warehouse clubs and supercenters in grocery retail vegetables are offered in a number of other food retail settings fresh vegetable #vendors are typically smaller and more community-oriented than other restaurant or retail food outlets and can include chain or independent grocery stores greengrocers storefront stands street carts and even makeshift platforms dedicated to the sale of fresh vegetables smaller community fresh vegetable vendors who may conduct business on the sides of major streets or on storefronts have played an integral role in the food environment in large urban centers such as new york city (nyc) particularly in ethnic enclaves despite the fact that fresh produce does not have a significantly higher nutritional value and fresh produce can also be purchased at these larger food retailerssince the covid-19 pandemic began many fresh fruit and vegetable vendors notably street carts selling fresh vegetables in cities across the united states including new york city have been forced to close owing to a combination of falling demand and fear of catching covid-19 the importance of fresh vegetable vendors varies by neighborhood within cities furthermore these fresh vegetable vendors attract visitors and interborough shoppers from a variety of cultural backgrounds not only asian ones who are looking for things that are not available elsewhere in the city or for the same low pricesthese fresh vegetable vendors unlike larger well-established grocery store vendors may not have the financial infrastructure to sustain the shifts in supply and demand produced by the covid-19 epidemic; consequently the danger of closure or modifications in services may be greater for these vendorsin order to assess the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on services offered by fresh vegetable vendors surveillance #data from both before and after the pandemic’s inception is requiredafter a few days vegetable dealers began venturing out without explicit permission and were quickly harassed by police after a few weeks the government relaxed the limitations allowing vital traders to sell their wares (due in large part to the advocacy of vendor organizations and activist networks) however the cost of doing business has increased dramatically as vendors no longer have access to wholesale markets and suppliers and they must spend more on travel expenditures owing to city-imposed travel limitations furthermore with the partial lockdown still in place the number of buyers has decreased as have earnings perishable vegetables have a shorter shelf life in the summer heat thus vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do haveconsider the situation of delhi at the starting of covid 19 the state has launched an inr 5000 crore stimulus package for over 50 lakh vendors realizing the serious consequences of their loss of livelihood the targeted relief for vendors is a credit facility that will provide all sellers with an initial working capital of inr 10000 but this will not be enough instead of credit the government should consider changing it into a direct income benefit such as a cash grant to help people start earning money on a regular basis the vendors require income support in order to resume work and how will they repay the loan if they are unable to do so vendor organizations must step forth in the face of the ever-changing crises and lobby for vendors to be given the resources they need to continue their livelihoods vendor organizations could use the following as part of their advocacy agenda:promotion of vendors’ livelihoods particularly those selling non-essential goods: covid-19 has had a particularly painful impact on informal labourers who have spent all of their savings and wages trying to feed themselves during the prolonged lockdown vendors must be permitted to restart peddling in order to survive and the government should take steps to reopen marketplaces and reintroduce vendors to the streetsmarket reopening with social distance and hygiene in mind: delhi features a variety of typically crowded markets including weekly markets (for fresh food cooked meals and necessary household items) and daily markets on the sides of highways these markets will need to resume considering the necessity for social separation and the government should issue recommendations in this regard in the future vending zones must be planned with social distancing in mind as well as adequate sanitary facilities (running water washing stations and toilets) for this the government should collaborate with town vending committees (tvcs)provide direct assistance that is not tied to existing registration requirements: when the lockdown is lifted and vending starts vendors who have been at home for months will require direct income benefits in order to return to work while the government stimulus plan is a positive step it falls short in terms of assistance (credit rather than direct cash transfer) and eligibility (only registered vendors are eligible which leaves out the majority of vendors in the country) furthermore government assistance and support must be divorced from the country’s strict registration requirements as only a few vendors have been registered in india only about 13100 of delhi’s 300000 street sellers have any type of employment identity if the state requires occupational identity for any type of monetary grant or livelihood assistance the government should accept registration with a workers’ organizationunion as a surrogate for government-issued vending passesproviding flowing water and soapsanitizers to street sellers at their place of business: the government should take steps to provide street vendors with running water and soapsanitizers at their place of business additionally vendor organizations should collaborate with local food safety authorities to instruct vendors (particularly those selling prepared foods) on how to maintain hygiene while on the jobtaking measures to conduct a survey and register additional vendors for government assistance: as previously stated the number of sellers with some sort of identity is a small percentage of the total number of vendors in delhi the town vending committees (tvcs) were expected to begin surveying and registering vendors before the crisis and ensuing lockout as we adjust to the new normal the survey and registration procedure should begin to guarantee that all vendors have access to social security benefits and financial assistance during this difficult timefinally some fresh vegetable sellers may have shuttered for a period of time early in the epidemic only to reopen recently alternatively vendors may have launched soon after the

              " 'as the coronavirus pandemic unfolds most industries face problems they had never imagined or prepared for the aviation and tourism industries face the highest stress as coronavirus spreads because not only are they a (usually) a leisure spending but also the nature of the disease directly conflicts with the industries’ innate business models in this article we will look at the impact of covid-19 pandemic on the tourism and aviation industries both from the demand side and the supply sidethe aviation and tourism industries has two major customers: tourists and business travellers let us base this essay in the india and see what the reaction of the customer segments is expected to be likealmost all tourists will avoid vacationing for the foreseeable future because of:financial hardship: an exceptionally large part of the world’s working population has been affected financially because of the pandemic unemployment rates are soaring and the ones who do still have a job are facing pay-cuts furloughs and deferment of salariesrisk of contraction: because the disease spreads via social contact it will only be safe to vacation if the destination is regularly sanitized and is not crowded inherently tourist destinations are not compliant with these regulations and even if the industry makes a change to being clean and introducing social distancing measures convincing risk averse tourists of to travel to these vacation spots will be difficultexpansion of alternatives ways to relax: as most people adapt to work-from-home environments the burnout rate is declining people are more relaxed in their own homes and very few people are eagerly looking for a getaway combined with this deterrent is the rise of alternative ways to relax more and more people are going out for walks doing yoga and finding new hobbies due to this increase for pursuit for happiness at home it might be likely that tourists will avoid traveling because they don’t feel the urge to break-free and move away for a holidaynow let us look at different types of holiday revellers tourists can be foreigners or domestic tourists according to business insider “in\\xa02019 almost 10 million foreign\\xa0tourists\\xa0visited\\xa0india\\xa0— spending over ₹1800 billion during january to november period” however because of the pandemic almost all this business has been lostdue to the reasons stated above most foreigners will not prefer to travel those who do dare to venture out perhaps wooed by discounted deals to places which would have otherwise been out of their budgets will possibly be warded off by the one of the following factors:poor quality of health care in india: in the off chance that a tourist contracts covid-19 they will probably be accustomed to a better healthcare system than the one india provides being a developing country india will find it hard to convince foreign tourists that our healthcare systems are up to the mark of their home countriesdensely populated regions around tourist destinations: because most tourist destinations support a neighbouring economy the areas are often densely populated which leads to a higher risk of transmission of covid-19 and the foreign tourists are cognizant of this factmoving our focus to domestic tourists we subdivide our population according to income levels:below poverty line: these people don’t travellower income families: these people majorly only travel to religious places or to visit family thus they don’t contribute to the aviation industry at all and generate very little revenue for the tourism industry as they prefer to stay in cheap lodges or at a relative’s placemiddle income families: they travel once in a year or two and tend to avoid airplanes revenue in the tourism industry is also limited from this subsectionupper middle income families: they vacation regularly often flying to near-by holiday spots this section of our economy is severely hit by the coronavirus’ financial hardships people have lost jobs and almost everyone has low liquidity being risk averse these people will probably save money and avoid spending on vacations for some time the loss of volumes from this sector will affect the aviation and tourism industries severelyhigh income families: this sector is relatively insulated from the financial hardships caused by coronavirus and is likely to spend on holidays if they are assured of the sanitization and social distancingin order to attract well paying customers the aviation and tourism industries will have to spend a considerable amount of money to become sanitation compliant which will push profit margins even lower most aviation and tourism activities made money not on individual margins but on collective volumes thus they are inherently incompatible with the concept of social distancingbecause of covid-19 pandemic businesses have realized that more and more meetings can be handled over video calls thus the movement of business personnel will be restricted there will still be some representatives who will fly out to conduct business but the industry can expect a permanent drop in revenue from this sectormoving over to the supply side the aviation and tourism industries face strong disruptions in their supply chain because the industry is a leisure expense manufacturing of many supporting equipment like the adventure sports gears and even parts of planes themselves has stopped because of the drop in demand it is going to be tough to get the supply chain back up again furthermore workers are afraid to show up to their jobs because of the high risk of contracting the virus due to exposure to multiple customers from different geographieslet us now see some examples of how the industry has done through march and aprilairbnbs (in america): the bookings vanished in mid-march property owners had bought or leased real estate to list on the app were severely affected the sharing economy like uber lyft and doordash had taken a hit but airbnb was worse off because their expenses include cleaning services interior design (one-time spend) and property maintenance which are fixed coststhus because of the pandemic the revenue was gone but the costs exist they have people who depend on the owner’s rental income which made the problem worsehosts usually decide cancellation policy but under extreme circumstances like this one the company decided to override all existing policies (many of whom weren’t strict) and gave full refund to the guests the company got $2 billion loan and has helped out the owners financially by paying 25% for cancelled bookings capping at 5khost they have helped some hosts by getting them eligible for small business loans and avoid evictionthankfully there are too few properties to cause a housing crisis but breakdown could cause strain on lenders and undermine property values (all want to sell to avoid foreclosure or defaulting on loans) airdna states that the listing split-up for airbnb is: 33% list single property 33% owners list 2-24 properties 33% hosts have 25+ propertiessome state governments in america have banned short-term rentals this hurt the airbnb owners because people looking to quarantine outside their homes or near relatives could’ve generated revenuesso what are hosts doing nowmany are discounting units and looking for long-term tenants (12 months) many are planning to apply for a small-business loan seek forbearance from banks find long-term tenants independently of airbnb and sell propertyreluctance of workers to comeback to work (america):according to the wall street journal roughly half of all us workers stand to earn more from the coronavirus rather than their work pay cheques however it must be noted that some have not gotten their money due to bureaucratical issuesthis complicates reopening because workers don’t want to come back and expose themselves to the virus and earn less but businesses want workers to come back so that their small business loans can be forgiven and business can reopen however money in the consumer’s pockets means the economy expected to rebound quickly when businesses open about 40 million americans are now on unemployment benefits majorly from restaurant hospitality and retail industriescongress chose a flat amount of relief because it was really time-consuming for payments to be calibrated to each worker’s lost wages their $600 federal payment corresponds to $15hours wage but 21 states follow $725hoursmost workers don’t want to sit at home and are anxious to get back to work but right now staying at home is the smartest financial decision for their familiesworkers should be ineligible for unemployment benefits if a job is made available to them but owners are reluctant to report workers to authorities and sever relationships with employees they may need more later in the year when tourism demand is expected to pick up without income support low-wage workers would likely seek out other jobs including side hustles and gig work which could expose them and their households to the virus thus according to the government it was important to give such a large stimulus to the economycoronavirus on planes:studies of sars suggested that people sitting close to infectious persons were at large risk combined with that in long journeys passengers may take off masks\\xa0thus the risks of transmission are large and airlines need to focus on figuring out how to prevent transmission in planescurrently the airlines plan on using self-cleaning material long-lasting disinfectant touchless lavatories uv light as a disinfectant antimicrobial coating for frequently touched surfaces and cleaning between flightshowever even after these efforts only 12% of people are flying (compared to last year same time) as of 27th may 2020aviation and tourism industries have the curse of being a luxury expense and thus as the coronavirus pandemic spread the entire industry jolted to a halt they are one of the hardest-hit sectors and have to adapt to a new normal wherein the revenue levels are unlikely to match to pre-covid levels and margins have also reduced however in with a bleak future this industry is here to stay because people have to travel and eventually they will vacation as well coronavirus has become a “survival of the fittest” test for this industry and the stakeholders will come out of this disaster with strong business processesblackcoffer insights 18: ishita srivastava bits pilani',\n",

pushing multiple businesses and industries to a moribund state other countries have also faced a similar predicament particularly in the us and europe both being hotspots for virus transmissionhowever upon taking a closer look at the global economy there seems to have been an upward mobilization in some of the sectors in the it domain these sectors seem to have exorbitantly increased their scale of operations and have overall reaped hefty profits so what is it that differentiates these areas from the rest and what can we learn from thema path to victoryif we look at the evolving itites industry around the world the domains that have flourished in this strenuous time all have had one key characteristic in common; flexibility these sectors have adopted a more flexible approach to dealing with the lockdown be it flexible working procedures or adopting newer more advanced ways of working in line with the requirements of our time they haven’t shied away from changing the rules of the game let’s look at some of these areas within the tech domain that have been successful in conquering the lockdownsocial medialockdowns around the globe have confined people inside their homes with nothing much to do of significance as a result social networking sites have reported a gigantic rise in user engagement over the lockdown period reportedly there has been close to a 50% rise in daily text transmissions across messaging platforms such as facebook instagram and whatsapp in the hardest-hit economies twitter has reported a 23% increase in its user base as compared to last year the data makes it evident that social media platforms are here to reap the benefits of a lockdown situationvideo consumption sites such as youtube instagram and tiktok are in line to reap massive profits it’s no wonder that viewership on these platforms has increased manifolds due to lockdowns these platforms serve to be a distraction from the tragedies of the real world in such stressing times and offer an easy escape be it rumors regarding the cure for covid 19 gossips or rap battles; these platforms provide viewers with their much-needed dose of distractions as they say “ignorance is bliss”data-mining enterprisesthe lockdown has proven to be a miracle for data-mining companies with such an exorbitant increase in the number of hours spent online globally these firms now have access to significantly larger sets of data than they otherwise could ever have widespread implementation of data-mining has been seen recently with most countries opting for government-regulated surveillance applications that monitor your movement at all times moreover these applications have access to your personal information as well as medical records countries such as south korea and singapore are at the helm of relying on such means to control the outbreakalthough noble such initiatives do raise a red flag with regards to user privacy the public has been provided with very little information about how these applications operate and what goes on behind the scenes this creates an atmosphere of obscurity that is frankly harmful to the premise of a democracycloud computingcloud computing has been on the rise for the last couple of years however the pandemic has made it the de facto king in terms of computational services with an increasing reliance on remote working the ability to store data in one secure location has turned out to be criticalthe cloud computing services such as amazon web services microsoft azure and google cloud have reaped hefty profits in the process the emerging landscape in the tech world seems to suggest an upward trend in reliability on these services as far as large scale data storage and computing is concernede-commercesocial distancing measures have made it practically impossible for people to physically go shopping for groceries and other necessities moreover a majority of retail outlets in cities have reported negligible engagement for the fear of transmission of the virus e-commerce sites have been the real winners in this predicament of global consumerismwith high standards of hygiene and at-home delivery these sites have provided an easy alternative to retail stores other similar businesses include food delivery apps and grocery sites that are also flourishing today amidst the pandemic recent weeks have made it evident that e-commerce websites are well on their way to abolish traditional shopping methodsott platformsonline streaming platforms consist of a relatively newer approach to entertainment; having only been in existence for the past couple of years they had already however established a name for themselves before the lockdowns sites such as netflix and amazon prime had been dominating a chunk of the market share and competing heavily with movie theatres for new releases for a while now now with the lockdown practically deleting theatres and cable tv from the collective psyche of the entertainment industry they are well on their way to becoming the platform of choice as far as entertainment for the masses is concernedthis has already become evident with zee5 india reporting a whopping 80% increase in subscriptions and a 50% increase in the time spent on their site within the first couple of weeks of the lockdown itself another such platform mubi reported a 28% rise in its viewership in india only a week after lockdown commenced these facts are a clear indication of the exponential growth that is in store for these platforms which is unlikely to change anytime soonvideo-conferencing platformsthe idea of working from home is all set to be the new norm in our professional culture which requires an easy and effective way to communicate over the internet not just audio or text but video conferencing is the need today hence it’s understandable why multiple video conferencing services are set to reap massive profits off of the new normarguably the most popular of these zoom has reported a 130% increase in its price share since the beginning of 2020 another such platform known as the microsoft teams collaboration suite operated by microsoft has reported a whopping 12 million increase in its user base in the very first week of the lockdown in the us this data is only likely to have an upwards trajectory considering the increasing pace at which industries are going onlinethe indian picturethe indian it landscape has also undergone massive cultural changes according to rajesh gopinathan chief executive officer and managing director of tata consultancy services ltd the “work from home” model of operations is here to stay he also claimed that the firms only requires a 25% workforce to be physically present for any project at any of the locationstata consultancy services which is one of the major players in the indian it landscape has shifted almost 90% of its workforce into a remote borderless workspace model and other smaller firms have followed suit what it tells us is that we’re headed in a direction we’re unlikely to return from remote working appears to be the modern protocol for operations and is unlikely to change anytime soonhowever a major challenge often overlooked in such circumstances is that of an adaptable culture the culture of workspaces has to be drastically altered and members of the workforce have to dive headfirst into the new way of doing business this is critical to ensure that the industry can combat the pandemic and recover gloriouslya duality unlike any otherthe lockdown has presented us with a stark contrast unlike any other we’ve witnessed where on the one hand the industries mentioned above seem to be exhibiting exponential growth with their people thriving and having every possible resource at their disposal the unorganized sector and the msmes (micro small and medium enterprises) seem to be at the crux of deaththe sector that consists of people for whom having guidelines to work from home is irrelevant as that was never really an option; people with no fixed wages or social security to fall back on during this time of crisis as a result of the lockdown several of these msmes have effectively become inoperable and have resorted to massive layoffs just to survive this has resulted in thousands of workers losing their jobs with nowhere to go to for refuge a chunk of these people includes migrant workers who have lost their jobs and are left with little to no avenue to feed themselves not receiving significant support from the government these people have been initiating treks back to their villages what is witnessed is a massive influx of migrant workers flooding the highways walking weeks to find shelter and food truck drivers responsible for delivering goods have also resigned stating that they have no means to eat because of the closure of every food joint on the highways both these realities present a stark contrast and expose a deep crack in our societal framework one i reckon won’t heal anytime soona train unlikely to haltthe covid 19 pandemic has restructured our social fabric in a way that is unlikely to change anytime soon the areas that we’ve discussed are likely to become the flagbearers of the digital revolution of the decade an upward mobilization with regards to massive scale movement of industries online seems pertinent today being led by these domains in the it industry an unfortunate consequence of it is that a majority of the msmes may soon cease to exist having been replaced by some of the other alternatives that we’ve discussed it seems to be a never-ending circle where the ones who are making a profit out of this situation will continue to do so while the others will be washed out from our collective memoryblackcoffer insights 18: souvik chakrabortyindian institute of engineering science and technology shibpur',\n",

research that shows that gamers have an enhancement of spatial distribution of attention compared with non-gamers this somewhat predictable practice effect occurs with both peripheral and central visual attention for sufferers of amblyopia (dimness or blurring of the eyesight due to a fault in transmission from the eye to the brain) video games may be helpfulmusculoskeletal problemspersistent gamers may also suffer from musculoskeletal problems a survey of children indicated increased physical complaints associated with video game playing such complaints range from pain in the hands and wrists to back and neck furthermore a case report involving a nine-year-old teenager referenced playstation thumb playstation thumb is characterized by numbness and a blister is caused by friction between the thumb and the controller from rapid and persistent gameplay using dermoscopy dermatologists discovered hemorrhages and onycholysis (the loosening or separation of a fingernail) in a patient who presented with hyperkeratosis also tendon injuries (tendinosis) of the hands and wrists from tendon overuse is another health problem associated with video game playing furthermore another case report in the new england journal of medicine reported a fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal from people who play wii video games this condition has been termed (perhaps sarcastically) a wii fracture there are also postural problems associated with the persistent playing of video games although ergonomic measures (including chair to monitor position) could potentially improve postural problems associated with video game playingobesity and overweightplaying video games consistently has been associated with obesity this is maybe related to the lack of physical activity in players alternatively it could be that those who are less physically fit because of obesity gravitate towards less physically demanding activities such as gaming in either case several studies have linked television and video games and increased body mass index (bmi) it has been estimated that children in the united states spend 25% of their waking hours watching either television or playing video games furthermore children who watch the most hours of television or play video games have the highest incidence of obesity if video games are replacing physical activities and young people do not participate in physical recreation or see playing of video games as a form of recreation this may be part of the link between times spent while playing video games and a rise in bmi in teenagers evidence for this potential link gains some support from a german study reporting that boys who spend no more than 15 hours per day engaged in television watching or playing video games were 754% less likely to be overweight than those who spend more than 15 hours engaged in the same activityin a 2011 study an association between video game activity and an increase of (mostly junk) food intake was reported specifically single video game sessions caused an increase in food intake regardless of appetite it has also been suggested that active video game play using two popular gaming platforms has the opposite effect other researchers found no evidence that more active video games would result in a beneficial outcome although the study did demonstrate an increase in the amount of physical activity within the children receiving the active video gamesseizures (epileptic)health concerns that video games may cause epileptic seizures started in the early 1980s the first medically documented case of a video game-induced seizure was reported in 1981 in 1993 a story in the popular press (sun newspaper) reported that a boy choked to death on his own vomit during a seizure triggered by playing a video game similar but less serious incidents were subsequently reported by news media around the world ultimately motivating video game console manufacturers to include that epilepsy warnings in the instruction manuals for their gaming products in 1994 it was reported that video games only cause seizures in people already predisposed to epilepsy and advised that people with a predisposition to epilepsy can greatly reduce the risk of a seizure by staying 10 feet or more away from the tv set and wearing sunglasses while playing video games this is clearly an area in need of additional researchprevention and treatment of online gaming disorderthe cost: benefit value of prevention versus treatment of addiction disorders has been known for many years it is important and beneficial to make use of several types of strategies in combating gaming addictiveness or disorder effective strategies include: educating gamers about gaming behaviors and consequences on their mental health; treatment geared towards helping the gamer to control hisher urge for video games recognizing and dealing with disturbing thoughts and learning how to cope without video games; intrapersonal and interpersonal counseling to help gamers to explore their identity build self-esteem and enhance their emotional intelligence outside the fictional world of gaming and learning communication and assertiveness skills needed in social interactions; family involvement including counseling and discussion family and other relationships; and developing new lifestyles the latter is particularly important and to paraphrase the well-known mantra of alcoholics anonymous it’s all about people places and things to prevent the persistent playing of video games people need to explore

              " 'finding ways to make using the internet easier is something most modern consumers are passionate about since the rise of ai-infused technology like amazon’s alexa or apple’s siri voice search has grown increasingly popular in fact nearly\\xa060 percent of people all over the world\\xa0use voice search at least once a dayas this technology grows more popular and complex with each passing day business owners are starting to take notice of voice search capitalizing on this trend is only possible when optimizing the content on your website for voice search are you trying to make your website more voice search-friendly if so check out the following tips1 accuracy of voice searchin the past if you wanted relevant answers from a voice recognition technology well—good luck with that but today machine learning systems can compete with people in terms of accuracy google’s voice recognition google is now able to understand human language with 95 percent accuracy these improvements mean that while you can trust good voice systems to match customers with the right products services or information with increasing degrees of nuance leading businesses already have set customer expectations for delivery thanks to machine learning algorithms that can detect speech and respond with meaningful results2 the interest in voice is only going to growbecause voice search systems are at a point where they actually can perform reliably and meet customer expectations just as well (if not better) than traditional query options customer trust in them is growing:60% of 18-to-49-year-olds\\xa0talk to automated voice systems at least once a dayvoice shopping\\xa0is expected to reach $40 billion by 2022—up from $2 billion in 2018;\\xa0global smart speaker sales\\xa0expected to exceed $30 billion by 202430% of people\\xa0who don’t have a voice assistant would like to buy one50% of smart speaker owners\\xa0would like to get information about deals sales and promotionsyet only\\xa04% of businesses\\xa0are properly optimized for voice search what’s with the disconnect in other words business leaders are at an ideal intersection where reliable systems are available and there are still many customers who haven’t been reached or who might want more out of the systems they currently use bringing those systems and customers together will help companies avoid being left behind3 people are after convenience and all types of informationwhen people use voice search they don’t just want to locate a great pair of shoes or a tv\\xa0people want all kinds of other information such as your store hours how to connect to support specialists and when you’re having your next sale this is partly why some experts have predicted a “totally different internet” within the next five to 10 years one where voice-activated chatbots have all but replaced the e-commerce channels we’re used to using shoppers are also after general tips that can take some of the friction out of everyday life—think life hacks and how-tos in fact words like “how” “what” “best” and “easy” are among the top voice search queries this means that when it comes to online marketing you probably need to change your entire optimization approach taking elements like grammar and semantics the structure of your site and structured data markup that influences google’s ability to find your content of course optimizing from the start not as an afterthought is ideal4 how voice become part of customer-brand interactions voice search can be used on both desktop and mobile searches we can see that customers want different types of information from voice systems they also can use it at many points in the customer journey for example about half of shoppers use voice to research products even “near me” searches results are mostly done by customers\\xa0customers also use voice to:add items to shopping lists (36%)track packages (30%)make a purchase (22%)give a rating or review (20%)contact support (18%)reorder something (17%)these statistics show you should think beyond just having customers find you or your products voice search and commands can take your buyers from start to finish so give your customers as much convenience and satisfaction as possible by integrating voice options into more types of interactions5 voice is often just the starting pointa\\xa0survey\\xa0showed that once a consumer makes a local voice search their next most common action is to call the business (28%) customers also are highly likely to visit company websites (27%) show up at the company’s location (19%) and do more research into that business or additional businesses (14% and 12% respectively) so in short while voice services can allow a customer to complete many steps without human interaction you shouldn’t see it as a total substitute many people are going to take further steps after the initial search and they still will want to hear a human voice respond back once in a while they are going to have more questions and they’re willing to physically connect with you and what you offer don’t drop the ball in other areas like making your site aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate having enough staff ready to chat listing an accurate contact number or keeping your store well-stocked voice search already is shifting the way customers engage with brands but there’s still time for companies of any size to get involved with voice systems in ways that can benefit both the customer and the business’s bottom line the next step is to find voice search solutions however as with other technologies these are not necessarily one size fits all meaning it’s critical to shop around and be specific about your goals if you can customize and update your options in a scalable way they’ll be even more effective for your business',\n",
              " 'the pandemic has shaken the world in the way one had hardly imagined the impact of it on jobs and services is going to be long-lasting and it will be the foundation stone of revolution in these sectors with the work from home and social distancing norms is altering the way of work the way we interact what work we will do how the work will be done and whatnot to just give an example in the middle of the first lockdown fmcg major hindustan unilever (hul) went ahead with its merger it took place online entirely yes it took place online who could have ever imagined the merger can take place onlinechange is inevitable but some changes are temporary and some are permanent the pandemic is bringing changes that are going to be permanent in fact these changes were due for a long time and we’re coming at a slow pace what the pandemic has done is it has become the catalyst for these changes and raised the ante for change so what exactly the changes will be let’s look at them one by onethe first change is going to be the extensive use of digital communication from now onwards the zoom jio meet google meet and some derivatives like these are going to be the forever meeting rooms where the important discussions will be held this may be bad news for the employees who are older than 40 years they would not have pictured themselves doing such transformation at this part of life experts believe that the new normal in the offices are going to be hierarchy-less the older employees would have to work with the younger ones there would be no geographical boundaries and where the communication and software adaptability among employees is going to be crucial the symbol of power will be less visible and the decentralization of power in the office will be prominent there will be more egalitarianism in companies the corporates will think much more about office space rather than expending too much on physical infrastructure the online infrastructure will always be in their hindsight the impact would be more prudent in small and mid-sized businesses the physical offices itself might disappear from such businesses but it’s not going to be easy for companies the security and confidentiality of the authentic information going out of the offices’ building are going to be the largest concern in the new normal world there would be no surprise if a lot of start-ups will bloom in the near future providing software for security for the data and information of the companies also travel is going to be reduced so the major component of ctc where the companies fooling the employees must find the other waythe second change is going to be struck down on employees already many of the companies and start-ups are reducing the workforce it is expected that new normal offices would work with an 80% workforce of that of the current workforce automation is on the verge due to safety reasons the companies are going to be more and more leaned towards automation with a minimal touch of human possible this might result in a loss of jobs in some sectors but it will also create new jobs in the automation sector it was evident from before pandemic too but now the velocity for the same would be increased in the new normal tech-enabled world the job which would be at stake dominantly would be managers’ managers the it firms have started firing the vice presidents and assistant vice presidents who draw hefty salaries but don’t really drive the business in the designation-less set up in the near future accelerated by pandemic they automatically become redundant for the first time the employees might be given jobs that would require more than the standard jobs also when the workforce in the company would be less in the company the employees might be given the option of working for extra time or working on the weekends and would be incentivized for the same rather than employing more staff and paying them full salary it is a win-win situation for both employees and companies employees can earn more than what they usually earn and will get to learn new which would be out of their primary domain the companies would be able to keep their costs low through this the assessment of employees might change too rather than going for an annual performance review the employees might be evaluated based on the tasks they perform creativity and innovation are going to be swords for the employees in the new normal world rather than designations in the office \\xa0the other change might be in the services sector the services like which involves maximum human touch will be the one which will be affected most adversely the safety concerns and confidence of people over the system are going to be the issue for at least the next few years it also opens the opportunity for something very new the products which could replace the need for visiting such services centers are going to create a boom in the market according to mckinsey the sales for such products are multiplying rapidlythere are speculations that the economies will tend to become minimalist economies let’s dig deep into this minimalist economies are the economies where people tend to refrain from purchasing luxurious items and focuses on purchasing necessities more and more\\xa0 well this is the position we are in right now during the pandemic people are expensing only necessary items like groceries and the demand for luxurious items is way below average but it would be hard to stay the same as this the minimalist economy will result in the deterioration of the economy in the short term it is true that in the minimalist economy the demand might be low but it would be wrong to assume the demand will be zero the high-quality products will gather the attention of the purchasers it is evident from past experiences that the economy always finds its way to come back from the mode of minimalist economy though this time may take some time it will surely return on trackbut every trouble comes with an opportunity this is the time for the companies to act now and grab the opportunities the pandemic has brought with him but for that companies are required to follow plans formulate strategies to suit their needs and pay more attention to the innovation the companies must form plans for the five stages from here these stages are 5rs: resolve resilience return reimagination and reformresolve: in the resolve phase companies need to formulate a nerve center to combat corvid itself the tendency of the company should not be like that they will return only after everything becomes normal in most parts of the country permission is granted to the companies for their operations if they wait for normalcy then bankruptcy might catch them before the normalcyresilience: the resilience phase includes maintaining liquidity addressing solvency and grow for sustainability all businesses should know when their cash crunch is coming addressing these cash crunches will be crucial for the companies businesses must take aggressive options to remain solvent for example the businesses might have cash in their hand but might be poor in operational efficiency then it requires the attention of the company organizations solving issues of liquidity and solvency will be in a better position to grow with sustainabilityreturn: in the third phase of return the companies will have to plan for the time when everything will be back on track given the possibility of subsequent waves of coronavirus the companies need new ways of working to prevent identify report and contain future flareups many industries will face this problem of returning staying prepared for resurgence scenarios should include a multi-scenario modeling exercise reverting to non-covid-19 care will require extensive planning and market testingreimagine: the phase of reimagining will include the learnings from the pandemic a small virus and the whole economy at the toss the businesses will have to introspect them and must look for advancements in technologies such that this kind of pandemic in the future will not disturb their efficiency too much the pandemic has taught us that the decision which took weeks and months in the normal world can be accelerated and can be taken in some days this should become a permanent feature cross organizational collaboration has become much easier this should stay in the long runreform: the last phase is the reform in this phase the companies should look at their bottlenecks and try to fix them also the companies will have to reconsider their relationship with their customers the confidence in their brands they must regain itthere are three ways to shift work talent and skills to where and when they are needed most thereby building the organizational resilience and agility necessary to navigate uncertain times and rebound with strength when the economy recoversmake work portable:in this dismal situation it is more important than ever most of the staff should be in the critical tasks the tasks could be like the customer complaints redressal we know that the customers are the ones who make the businesses successful thus retaining their confidence is the utmost priority the organizations can convert some of the staff to address the queries and concerns of customers the organizations require to create virtual offices there should not be the geographical boundaries within the organization the employees from all over the world from the organization should come together and take the organization back to pre-corvid state by breaking out of rigid job constraints the right talent and work can be matched to solve evolving business challenges in real-timeaccelerate automation:this was happening before the pandemic too but accelerating it with pace has now become the need of the hour the perception that automation is a job-killer is totally wrong and in fact it is the mandatory capability to deal with the crisis organizations can increase automation in call centers this will reduce the response timeshare employees in cross-industry exchanges:temporarily moving employees from some industries like airlines restaurants hospitality can be moved to those organizations which have maximum work at this time like healthcare and logisticsto conclude the companies should understand “lives come first but livelihood matters” the pandemic will have some adverse effects on jobs and services but this is not the end the pandemic has brought many opportunities with him and if they are grabbed then the organizations would be in much better position even compared to pre-corvid situations the companies need to understand the pandemic is not going to be forever the last concluding sentence will be

              " 'social media is such a staple of our evolving digital culture that it’s almost hard to imagine a time without updates likes comments and shares people are more concerned about how their food looks than about how it tastes thus it has become necessary for any brand to have a social media presence the phrase “out of sight out of mind” has never been so apt than in today’s time social media is as much about engagement with other people as it is about sharing content it’s why we call it “social” mediasocial media engagement simply is the interaction between the customer and the brand on social media platforms where else are you going to find a huge database of your target demographic who are already in the mind frame to read click on and share your messagein practicality it is not about a one-off communication but more about the construction of a long-term relationship with your target customers hence when we talk about such a relationship it is imperative to consider the positive actions of users as a reaction of any brand’s engagement tacticsa fundamental customer journey can be envisaged in the form of customer funnel the touchpoints available at every step can be shown as:\\xa0awarenessconsideration\\xa0decisionpurchase\\xa0post-purchase\\xa0touchpoints\\xa0word of mouth social media regular advertisements on the customer journey map\\xa0congruence with

millions)how many retweets on twitter how many reactions to the post on facebook how many likes on instagram how many shares on linked in this seems to be the new age resumethus a good question or mystery for any brand is how to measure their social media engagement as with most online actions it’s often difficult to measure offline benefits more often than not the online campaigns do not drive any conversions on the same dayweek but a user may see those posts and become more familiar with the brand that familiarity later on might result in him choosing that brand over an unknown competitor

continued to grow and diversify its portfolio while providing constant engagement to its plethora of followers especially on instagram\\xa0cross-channel marketingcross-channel marketing or multi-channel marketing is the practice of using multiple channels to reach an audience because not everyone uses every single platform it’s a good idea to have a presence on a few and share some of the same content across the different networks what makes a difference in this marketing strategy is the choice of platforms apart from using basics like facebook instagram and twitter a clever use of

addition to the customers the brand must constantly keep informing the customers about their existing products new products achievements of the brands or even casual content there should be “wow i didn’t know this” factor only then will they become regular followers of the brandan example of this would be a cosmetic brand posting make-up tutorials fenty beauty is one such prime example which

              " 'petty entrepreneurs like streetside food stalls form an essential part of an economy that plays a significant role in balancing the development of a nation’s economy the importance of street food vendors not only helps in increasing the country’s per capita income but also helps to make a living for the unemployed in society with a limited investment most of them are the sole breadwinners for their families so with the covid-19 wreaking havoc the uncertainty of the lockdown policies increased the concern of people over hygiene and the lack of investment to upgrade their businesses to provide better hygiene facilities that can take away food from their mouths\\xa0various states have provided relief packages and support but in a country as populous as ours it has hardly been appropriately implemented delhi for instance recently announced a rupee 500 million stimulus package to nearly 500000 rupees recognizing the severe consequences of the loss of livelihoods the seller’s intended remedy is a credit loan that provides all sellers with an initial working capital of rs 10000 but this is not enough instead of loans the government should consider converting them directly into income benefits cash subsidies to secure a livelihood in order to initiate income-generating activities on a regular basis sellers need income support to get back to work and if they can’t they will never be able to repay the loan amount in an ever-changing crisis organizations need to take a step forward and ensure that providers are provided with the resources they need to make a living pandemics have had a vast economic impact on every sector but the most vulnerable sectors such as street vendors suffer the most decreased income can affect most necessities such as payments to family and yourself due to a lack of fixed salaries stalls cannot quit their jobs if possible it might be only a few days unlike regular employees for them the risk of infection is far less frightening than hungerunlike many of the businesses most of these food vendors lack the infrastructure to go online and sell products through platforms like swiggy or zomato“regret not going digital before” says dilip das a street side food stall owner at sector v kolkata dilip das used to run a small streetside food stall that provided meals to all the employees around the area which is filled with multinational companies it was a booming business till the arrival of covid then with the lockdown arriving almost all the companies opted for work from home policies dilip tried to start deliveries but with a lack of support and fear of infection that business ended before it even startedciting similar reasons swapan mondal who runs a south indian food stall at park street said that he did know how to operate a smartphone and since sales were good he did not care about learning either but with the implementation of lockdown which took place within 4 hours people like swapan barely had time to cope with the changesfurthermore the covid 19 pandemic made people realize how important trains are in our life with most of the train network suspended the entire supply chain was disrupted hundreds of quintals of food products rotted away awaiting the logistical issues to fix many businesses could not afford to run without proper supplies as wellto handle such issues vendors organizations may consider the following solutions:promotion of livelihood for all vendors including sellers of non-essential goodsthe impact of covid19 was extremely severe for informal workers who ran out of capital and income and to try to feed themselves during this long embargo sellers need to be able to resume sales in order to survive and governments need to take steps to reopen the market and bring sellers back to the businessreopening of markets keeping in mind social distancing and hygieneindia has different types of traditionally crowded markets even weekly markets (fresh food cooked food and essentials) and daily roadside markets these markets have to reopen with the need for social distance in mind and the government needs to publish guidelines for that in the future

(tvc)provision of direct support that is devoid of existing registration requirementsonce the restrictions are lifted and the impact of covid 19 is somewhat manageable sellers who have been at home for months will need direct income benefits to help them to return to work the government initiative is a welcome move but not in terms of the type of bailout and eligibility is enough in addition

marketsin india distribution utilities have a lower tariff for domestic and agricultural consumers sometimes even below the average cost of supply as compared to that for commercial and industrial consumers table 1 provides the electricity tariff rates in delhi for selected consumer categories to highlight these differences thus for several distribution companies the lower tariff-paying

commercial activities across the country approximately 13 billion citizens are obliged to remain within the confines of their homes and in many cases only allowed to work from home consequently the electricity demand from industrial and commercial customers has reduced significantly while the residential demand is expected to have increased according to the power system operation corporation of india (posoco) the energy met on march 16th 2020 – which can be considered as a business-as-usual scenario – was 3494 mu as compared to 3113 mu on march 23rd 2020 a day of voluntary curfew\\xa0it further reduced to a range between 2600-2800 mu\\xa0between march 25th\\xa0to march 31st 2020 this trend is illustrated in the below figure 1figure1: daily energy met (mu)thus firstly a key risk from the covid-19 pandemic for the already struggling distribution companies in india arises from the loss of revenues due to the reduction of demand from the commercial and industrial customers as well as the inability to cover the cross-subsidies provided to the lower-tariff paying consumer secondly the utilities would also have to account for the expense to comply with any ‘must buy’ commitments that they have with generators with long-term power purchase agreements the true and full extent of this risk would only be known once a quantitative analysis is conducted when this crisis situation is contained thirdly at an operational level distribution companies would have to account for deviation in demand and supply patterns at a temporal and locational level finally during this period critical infrastructure such as electricity networks would have to be run with minimum employeescovid-19 impact on the power marketas seen in figure 1 the trade on the wholesale power market comprises just 43 percent of the total electricity transactions however the transactions through the power exchanges have grown over the last decade the indian energy exchange (iex)\\xa0has seen a growth from 2616 mu in fy 2009 to 52241 in fy 2019figure2: share of market segments in total electricity generation 2018-19 (source: cerc)\\xa0until now the trade in the wholesale market is in four market segments:1) day-ahead market\\xa02) term ahead market\\xa03) renewable energy certificates4) energy-saving certificates\\xa0recently the central electricity regulatory commission (cerc) finalized the regulations for implementing real-time markets this\\xa0half-hourly market\\xa0will enable the intra-day trade of electricity allowing adjustment of generation and consumption profile during the day before the covid-19 pandemic it was announced by cerc that the real-time market would be operational from april 1st 2020 however the starting date has now been delayed by two months to june 1st 2020\\xa0according to media reports due to the covid-19 pandemic some required trials could not be completed this delay in the real-time market implementation is likely to have a serious adverse impact on the indian power marketanother impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the power markets is in terms of the market dynamic it can be observed that there is a dip in the clearing volume and the market-clearing price which coincides with the gradually increasing shutdown measures taken by the government as a response to covid-19 (see figure 2) thus the reduction in demand due to the lockdown is reflected in the volumes traded on the electricity market and the clearing priceanother point of reference is the price and clearing volume in 2019 on march 22nd 2020 the day of voluntary lockdown the clearing volume was 9705 gwh and the clearing price was 219548 ₹ mwh in comparison\\xa0on the same day in 2019 the clearing volume was 10798 gwh and the clearing price was 281618 ₹ mwh from the start of the lockdown from march 25nd to april 1st 2020 the average clearing volume was 10427 gwh compared to 13024 gwh in 2019 during the same period similarly\\xa0the average market clearing

has resulted in a shutdown of the industrial and commercial establishments and the stoppage of passenger railway services this has adversely impacted the all india electricity demand given that these segments constitute about 40% of the all india electricity demand a statement issued by the rating firm saidfurther these segments account for an even greater percentage of the discoms sales revenues given that they are the subsidizing segments this apart with the focus of state governments being on healthcare and relief measures the likelihood of subsidy support to the discoms getting deferred cannot be ruled out it addedicra ratings group head and senior vice president – corporate ratings sabyasachi\\xa0majumdar said “the lockdown imposed by the government is likely to adversely impact the all india electricity demand with demand expected to decline by about 20-25% on a year-on-year basis during the period of lockdown this would in turn adversely impact the revenues and cash collections for distribution utilities in the near term especially given the consumption decline from the high tariff paying industrial and commercial consumers and likely delays in cash collections from other consumer segments the revenue deficit for the discoms is estimated to be about rs 130 billion per month on an all india basis this would in turn adversely impact the liquidity profile of the discoms increase their subsidy requirement and lead to delays in payments to the power generation and transmission companies”the power ministry on friday issued directors to the central electricity regulatory commission to provide a moratorium of three months to discoms on payments to power generation and transmission companiesthe power ministry on friday issued directors to the central electricity regulatory commission to provide a moratorium of three months to discoms on payments to power generation and transmission companies and requested state governments to issue similar directions to state electricity regulatorsthe power generation companies are already suffering delays in payments by discoms across the majority of states with payment due of more than rs 85000 crore as of november 2019 at all india level as per the data on praapti portalwith covid-19 lockdown accentuating the delays in payments the availability of adequate liquidity buffer in the form of debt service reserve and undrawn working capital limits remains important from a credit perspectivehowever it said that relief measures such as a moratorium on debt servicing over a 3-month period as notified by reserve bank of india and expected moderation in the interest rate cycle would be a source of comfort in the near term the timely approval of the moratorium by the boards of the banks and financial institutions remains crucialthe revenues for power generation companies having long-term power purchase agreements (ppas) with the state distribution utilities (discoms) will be protected by the provision for capacity charges linked to plant availability in case of thermal and large hydropower projects and “must-run” status in case of nuclear and renewable power projectsaverage monthly thermal plf would further dip to 50-52% against 63% in the corresponding period of the previous year due to a considerable drop in demand and consequently power generation companies especially those without any long-term ppas would be adversely impacted given the weakening of the power tariffs in the short-term  power exchange market said icra ratings sector head & vice president girishkumarkadamthe under-construction renewable power projects as well as epc and manufacturing companies in the solar segment are likely to face execution delays because of disruption in the supply chain in india and labor availability following the lockdown given the import dependency on china for sourcing pv modules the execution timelines for the ongoing solar projects are likely to be affected by delays in the delivery of pv modules following the outbreak of covid 19 in chinathis delay in turn would increase the pre-operative expenses and the overall project cost which in turn would have an impact on the expected returnsin this context the mnre has notified that time extension can be provided for all renewable energy projects which are impacted by the supply chain disruption due to the covid outbreak under the force majeure clause“given the execution headwinds amid covid 19 affecting q1 of fy2020-21 and assuming the normalcy thereafter the capacity addition in the wind and solar segments together is likely to degrow by about 25% thus estimated at about 8 gw against earlier estimates of 11 gw in fy2020-21” said kadamfigure: cleared volume (above) and market clearing price (below) for iex

              " 'in december 2019 a novel coronavirus strain (sars-cov-2) emerged in the city of wuhan china the disease called covid-19 spread to almost every nation in the world creating widespread havoc and disruption in routine life who recognized it as a pandemic on march 10 2020 as of april 19 2020 worldwide around 24 lakh people have been infected and more than 16 lakh people have succumbed to covid-19though a vaccine hasn’t been developed yet the spread of coronavirus can be stopped by washing hands frequently covering one’s mouth while coughing and practicing social distancing from other people countries across the world are using lockdowns as an effective way to stop the spread\\xa029 kb of rna has brought the world down to its knees one-third of the global population has been in lockdown schools colleges businesses services that are considered non-essential have been put on hold for an indefinite period even after lifting restrictions a global recession even worse than the one in 2008 is going to be expectednow arriving at the main field of discussion ie hospitality industry how covid-19 impact hospitalitypropulsion was building for 2020 to be a year of focal collective action on sustainability the covid-19 outbreak has emphasized more than ever the importance of future-proofing business for growth and resiliencethe hospitality industry includes various services like lodging food and beverage events tourism transportation theme parks etc before covid – 19 prevailed we all know that this industry was in much demand and was also one of the major sources of the rising economy during vacation and festive periods these were always full of people worldwide as of now due to the havoc created and ongoing lockdown they are bearing many losses and is one of the main reason for the decreasing economyhave you ever thought of hotels been converted into hospitals quarantine centers and isolation centers\\xa0 yes my dear people amidst this outbreak many of the hospitality industry properties be it tiny or enormous have come forward to help the nation fight this life-menacing virustaj hotel in mumbai is attentively aware of its responsibility towards the community and has opened its doors for the major frontline workers ie medical fraternities to stay at their place while they combat the spread of this treacherous virusalso many of the government bodies have been transformed to provide shelter to the homeless recently in vadodara – gujarat the building which was built for the employees aiming to work for the major mumbai-ahmedabad bullet train project has been come forward to make it an isolation center for doctors and nurses“railways – the lifeline of citizens” as railways have started their service years ago from that period they are being considered as the lifeline of citizens in many metropolitan cities today at the time of the global pandemic railways haven’t backed off from the position of the lifeline yes my dear friends you have heard it right railway coaches in india have been turning into the hospital and isolation centers marking their presence by helping the government to increase the number of isolation beds also many special parcel express trains are running in the entire nation to fulfill the needs of people by transporting essential commodities and goodshospitality has been one of the most innovative industries in the crisis so far connections have been rapidly formed to donate food and beverages to local charities from various hotels many of the hospitality bodies are standing in solidarity with the communities affected by this threatening disease by lighting their windows in the shape of a heart seen in hotels across the worldwith this outbreak there is a sharp drop in tourists worldwide as the aviation railways and public transport buses have come to a standstill due to severe government restrictionstoday it is clear that hospitality industries must be prepared for various situations like a pandemic climate change etc as of now they are facing devastating and disastrous covid-19 impact on its various sectorsthe debt being the normal capital intensive component has to be serviced by payment of interest on debt and repayment of debt hotels being labor-intensive have lots of fixed costs such as wage bills besides paying government levies minimum load charges etc the earlier indian hospitality industry was on average witnessing 65 to 70% of occupancy till the end of february the first few days of march were fine once things started accelerating the occupancy has gone down to a severe minimum also as soon as the pandemic ends by god’s grace the hospitality industry will still face some loss as the tourists will be much lesser in the beginning monthsas soon as the crisis gets over the hospitality industry will have a very crucial role to play in rehabilitating lives within their local communities millions of people will be unemployed leaving them at high risk of poverty and exploitation as the industry starts to recover hospitality will be one of the sources to increase employment to the needy ones taking the poverty level to a minimumwithin india after the crisis over people should travel to the less known and highly economically affected destinations to help the hospitality industry overcome the loss they bore due to covid-19hence the hospitality industry suffered and is suffering a lot due to this pandemic and despite that it is also helping the nation to win against this dangerous disease thus covid-19 impact on hospitality\\xa0“let’s be grateful to all the frontline workers saving the entire nation and also be thankful to all the various sectors of the hospitality industry who have come forward to help and serve the nation”soon we

              " 'as a race we are not ready for any kind of crisis we have fire extinguishers in buildings but barely any knowledge of how to use it we convince ourselves that we are prepared but in the face of adversity we stand dumbfounded and give the simplest excuse that of being in ‘unprecedented times’ the same thing has happened with the coronavirus crisis if we look back we can see that this crisis was not avoidable there was a lot we could have done but because we underestimated it so much the situation has now blown out of proportion and cost us thousands of lives millions of jobs and a massive hit to the world economy we may be in a unique condition but there is still a lot that we can apply from past experiences and previous calamities\\xa0first let’s look at this in a reflective mode what are the things we could have done to avoid this crisis in the first place controlling the origin of a virus is difficult but preventing it from spreading is not one of the biggest contributors to this unforgiving crisis is the lack of communication or even worse the propagation of fake news take india for example clear communication about the virus was only initiated after a few cases had been identified we were aware of the hazards of this virus since before and should have acted sooner the spread of accurate and timely information is a must if we had spread awareness earlier we could have controlled the number of cases better like new zealand and ireland have done secondly in a situation of crisis the first thing to spread is fake news it is imperative that the government social media agencies and people themselves act more responsibly since there is no accurate and transparent information a lot of uncertainty exists in the society this impacts the confidence of consumers and investors in the market which in turn leads to an economic slowdown past experiences with financial breakdowns and recessions have shown us that retain market trust can only occur with transparency and accuracy of information organisations should have acted earlier and communicated more effectively with their employees\\xa0moreover we must also understand that specific sectors take the hardest hit during lockdowns as we have witnessed in earlier lockdowns curfews national emergencies and pandemics the first segment of society to take a hit is the daily wagers and labourers not only do the prices of goods increase but their income also takes a decline in such a crisis in such situations they can’t even afford basic amenities india witnessed a mass exodus recently with thousands of people trying to return to their villages on foot this only leads to more chaos and a decline in containment of the disease the government should have accounted for such factors before announcing a lockdown with a four hour notice they could have made better arrangements for food and water in the metro cities itself or giving them safer means to travel home\\xa0this is something that they can still include in their relief programsgovernment intervention is a must right now this can be done in two ways first is to create more employment opportunities governments used this strategy in the sars and ebola virus emergency health water sanitation and hygiene are the most services in the times of health emergencies intense investment for these services and infrastructure can provide immediate jobs secondly if governments use fiscal and monetary policy to fuel demand and maintain current living standards it can decrease the propensity of a huge fall in economic growth a fiscal stimulus by the government can make all the difference having better avenues for cash transfers easier loans and more exchange will automatically help a fall in the growth rate is unavoidable as lots of sectors have no choice but to pause all work however industries that can provide high returns even now must be encouraged for example it sector health food and agriculture etcmoreover governments and businesses should use the most important tool in their hand the internet even in the times of physical social distancing we are still connected to people across the world and are socialising at our normal rates governments should use these mediums to maintain public spirit communicate policy strategies and inform people businesses should use these means to continue working and maintain employee morale to have balanced crisis management and to prevent panic in the masses social dialogue and engagement at every level is imperative use these mediums to educate people about the importance of social distancing hygiene and steps to be followedall diseases are different and the scientific approach to tackle them varies however with most epidemics and pandemics some common steps can be followed our past experience with fast spreading diseases has shown that the easiest and most effective way to curb it is social distancing countries have taken impressive steps to ensure social distancing and must keep this up for even a few weeks after curbing the disease maintaining sanitary habits and hygiene can protect us from infections and increase our immunity while governments and medical agencies look for ways to tackle the virus at a macro level we must continue to follow all measures on an individual level toowe must also pay a lot of attention to mental and physical well-being now in the past when economies took a hit due to the 2008 recession or calamities the first thing to break was people’s self-esteem suicide rates amount of domestic abuse and cases of depression increased manifold we have to take effort and ensure that we try and live as much of a balanced life as possible we should stay connected to our friends and not be ashamed of reaching out to others for help social distancing is not easy and can take a toll on many lots of special helplines have been set up for the same and people must use them if needed governments have also given code words for victims of domestic abuse to report crimes in countries like france and spain we must remember to stay mentally healthy and calm during a crisis as that is the most important thingi don’t believe that every crisis is the same of course there are a lot of unique things about the coronavirus pandemic that we had not expected to ever see even though these are different times there are still lots of things we can apply from our past experiences we cannot find a cure for the virus but we can find ways to maintain the economy our mental peace and prevent the spread of the virus the past has a lot to offer if we ponder we must learn to understand the mistakes of the past and better them in the future our past experiences with the different crises have taught us that fiscal stimuli work maintaining employee morale is important and that social engagement is imperative if we use these tools efficiently we can ensure that people only have to fight the virus and not worry about the multitude of repercussions that come with itblackcoffer insights 17: vani milind agarwal shri ram college of commerce (srcc)',\n",
              " 'covid-19 an unprecedented pandemic for us but a “can-be” possibility for great leaders such as bill gates came into action since the rising of the year 2020 the corollary of this pandemic is so prodigious that the analysis by the un department of economic and social affairs (desa) stated that the covid-19 pandemic is disrupting global supply chains and international trade which in turn could shrink the global economy by up to 1 percent in 2020 a reversal from the previous forecast of 25 percent growth more than 66 million americans filed unemployment claims and the economic downturn is expected to be the worst recession since the great depression as stated by the imf india is facing its biggest crisis in decades with a three-week lockdown initially but extending further in a nation of 13 billion people likely to result in an economic recession millions of job losses and possible starvation among the poor it can be said that economic contagion is now spreading as fast as the disease itself on the contrary nature has pressed the reset button the environment is having a noticeable benefit from this scenario water is getting clearer the air is turning breathable and various such news and pictures can be easily heard and seen on newspapers telly and social media platforms on day to day basis but this is the storyline of the present what about the future are the predictions made by financial institutions and thought leaders going to be true or something unexpected is going to happen that will make us think of our human capabilities againafter this storm of covid-19 it would not be a surprise to see how digitally every business will grow to provide better digital infrastructure and customer experience along with advancement in technology which we are lacking in this present scenario the touch screens that we are using already will find its vast applications and would be seen in most of the places including hotels hostels and shopping malls all those processes which are interdependent will take an agile turn resulting in better productivity of goods having a systematic backup giving a better experience to the consumer even in hard situations the major focus would be making contactless systems hence artificial intelligence and machine learning will become the most rapid and in-demand fields not only this but the medical infrastructure and services will also take a boost in the race of developing the systems to handle any situation afterward the human to machine interaction will increase facilitating fast production delivery and surveillance inculcating many more in each and every area the covid will leave its mark may it be retail sector or may it be the banking sector making them modify or fully change their architectureseven the existing systems would be gifted with some modifications ensuring them to work in a hard environment even with or without human intervention the companies will rethink their policies shaping themselves accordingly to manage the resources ensuring safety agility and work to be a top priority the work from home idea will also provide a base for bigger companies ensuring to develop a better infrastructure for their resources and probably giving birth to a new concept of work culture various existing industries related to either delivery or travel may adopt the new idea of collaboration with other industries which will result in more options for consumers on their old routine appsnew businesses will root out from the existing ventures resulting in head to head competition in the business world but turning into a brownie point for consumer experience and bandwidth of choices start-up culture will go hand in hand and expected to take a stupendous growth in the race of providing us a legitimate opportunity to use and feel the real digital world the various innovations will now take a pace in each field and maybe we will hear some new jargons related to tech in upcoming years since the global economy has fumbled countries will now try to take a different turn to vamoose out of this phase they will try to make new connections by nurturing a give and take relationship and several business relationships would take an unexpected move making the position of several countries sliding up and down on indexes even rival countries may join their hands in this hard time rather than being dismissed totally under predator countries it would be surprising to see how these scenarios will be handled by the emperor of minds and how their opponents are going to take it as an agenda for the next electionsunfortunately the nature that is at its best will start to face the ill effects after the chart of development and economy will take a pace for exponential growth it is unfortunate that the inverse relationship between economic growth and environmental destruction exists since carbon emission increases with economic development as shown by the graph below whenever recession took place the carbon emission decreases along with other harmful gases turning out as a gift for nature but doom for the financial marketsbut there is a possibility that several start-ups now emerge with the idea of environment conservation collaborating with ngos innovating and using the best of their capability to reduce the ill effect from the present origin pointin the culmination we can say this pandemic is like “blessing in disguise ” producing a massive impact not only on macro but also on micro-economy the novel virus not only brought some unexpected results but also uncovered some of our loopholes and unlatched new opportunities for growth forcing us to define ourselves in several new spheres quite a while ago we all were chit-chatting about the digital era how this is benefiting us covid-19 revealed making us realize this was just the beginning of digital era and a lot is needed to happen in future it is obvious that not only the indian economy but the global economy is facing and going to face the aftereffects however similar to a virus the economy will also rise from deep grounds to a green candlestick with individual collaborationthe businesses will soon rise again people will get back to their jobs vendors will start getting profits and everything will fall into its places but now a megalithic competitive environment will rise which will grow till decades until nature again shows it’s color and we as a human abide with its outcomes learning some new lessons and keeping this cycle of fall and growth

              " 'perhaps the virtual illusion has become today’s “new reality”inquisitive about the conclusion let’s attempt to vindicate as the outline story unfolds itselfever since the concept of gaming floated back in the 1970s a new dimension was put before human beings intangible in nature and paradoxically engulfed us since then it laid an impact on multiple generations in different ways the last decade witnessed a boom in this industry & with the advancement of technologies in virtual and augmented reality the gaming world has become an integral part of our day to day experiences with the intent of being regarded as a leisure activity it has now percolated over various strata and has managed to gather the attention of teenagers and adolescents on a comprehensive scaleas we explored the fabric of our engineering batch mates we came across this peculiar guy holding excellent academics with accolades of his names seemed to be a nerd at a glance and street smart by nature concomitance happened to be the reason for experiencing the lifestyle of other personalities that included sam as wellsam was not only fascinated by the games but used to spend tirelessly hours and hours in front of the white screen engrossed completely leaving the track of time as our academics advanced the intensity of involvement in gaming grew deeper and steadily it turned into addiction in no time we realized the gravity as we were exposed to his change of behavior and shift of priorities due to his unprecedented absence during our lectures and practical he was modestly reluctant to share about his whereabouts with his peers the situation turned grim when he wasn’t able to cope up with the subjects and was socially disturbed while interacting he was compelled towards the fantasy world and was trapped in the vicious cycle of a never-ending backlog of games as time progressed his performance turned from bad to worse he was struggling it was clear as ice that he had something hidden behind that visageas sophomores we were also involved in gaming but soon realized that it does more harm than good a close cluster of friends decided to lend a helping hand to sam and as they learned about him the ground beneath their feet slipped away and froze their brain he had completely lost the circadian rhythm of his sleep ran into financial losses aggression draped him his relations were tarnished due to the habitual routine and signs of depression were visible on the upfrontpoker was the tartar that he had caught the game of cards as most of us would perceive it rather proved to be the fulcrum of sam’s near future in the quest of pleasure through online games he entered the tunnel of gambling at a very tender age ignoring the risks involved in terms of financial verticals he was suffering from internet gaming disorder (igd) & his condition deteriorated as days passed by apparently from a healthy individual to a drained skinny one it took a toll on his physical health mental disturbance sucked him and he grew insensitive towards his academics the psychological negative consequences were due to the combination of online gaming and gambling platforms during that phase the peer group (gaming group) gained more influence than parental control\\xa0days arrived when he ran short of money and went ahead to ask his friends in college for the funds since a large amount of money is involved in gambling a situation exacerbated when sam had his ethical values on the line and breached his boundaries to satisfy his hunger of gaming and leaped towards illegal means to fund his gamblingthe practical project was a crucial part of our engineering curriculum under which a team of four members was to be established and is expected to remain intact for a year sam was by no means in anyone’s good books no one in the batch was ready to risk with sam even though he possessed a brilliant acumen he was abandoned we were three friends already and were scouting for the fourth with mutual consensus we decided to go ahead with sam initially we worked together and collaboration seemed to be perfect unfortunately he wasn’t able to clear his backlog exams and had to drop out at present he plays poker on a professional level keeping aside his engineering career and battling with his conscience that we may not be aware of\\xa0\\xa0earlier generations used to spend their time or rather invest their time into activities building up their passion in some cases they pushed their cognition to such an extreme and contributed to a level that humanity as a whole is in-depth to date can we imagine our present without the existence of sir edison sir newton sir tesla sir einstein and many more that were engrossed in their domain and served the necessary impetus for our generation no one knows that sam could have been our generation scientist hadn’t he chose that path\\xa0\\xa0not everyone is sam but perhaps we could miss our einstein or tesla maybe our newton is waiting for the new upgraded version of the game instead of sitting under the tree our mendeleev might be involved in arcade games\\xa0feels so numb\\xa0\\xa0millions of teenagers are involved in online gaming platforms and the community is growing at a rapid rate every year presently the prevalence of igd among the adolescent group was between 13% to 199% and males reported more prevalence than females in the fiscal year 2019 there were 300 million online gamers in india this number was estimated to go up to 440 million gamers by the fiscal year 2022 overall

leading to chemical imbalance thus causing severe depression and anxiety attacks\\xa0\\xa0as per the world health organization depression is interrelated to physical and mental health and the word ‘depression’ that didn’t exist decades back has become prevalent among the youth leading to more stress and dysfunction and worsening the affected person’s life situationanything in excess is poison

              " \"epidemics in general have both direct and indirect costs associated with direct and indirect measures adopted to counter (control) the epidemic which generally have both short-run and long-run economic and social consequences the 2019 coronavirus (covid-19) outbreak globally lead a significant setback to the entire globe the first case was detected on 26th december 2019 in china\\xa0 the world health organization (who) prepared the first diagnostic kit on 14th january 2020as the global coronavirus or covid-19 pandemic continues to take hold every economy is feeling it’s effect with a high degree of uncertainty taking a toll in all the manufacturing sectors supply chain management is an important area with many opportunities for our community to contribute in various forms \\xa0according to the data produced by supply management’s report on business show that pmi (purchasing manager’s index) has declined 1% in the month of february mainly there has been a huge contraction in the petroleum transportation and textile industries although there has been a fall in the inventory but is expected to grow due to supply chain disruptions leading to inefficiencies in material conversion and continued advanced stocking to protect production schedules a analysis by trading platform forex claimed that heavily 75% of all companies had already reported supply chain disruptions with more than 80% believing that at some point they would experience impacts as a result of covid-19 disruptions the effective shutdown of industrial activity ie china ground zero for the virus presented particularly difficult problems for manufacturing firms worldwide imported goods invested by investors set a significant setbackseveral experiments were carried out by different governments across the globe to restrict the spread of this pandemic boris johnson introduced the herd immunity plan in the united kingdom which was a failure followed by a mitigate model which india also tried initially to stop the spread of the covid-19 virus the last and the ultimate model that most of the countries are applying is the hammer and the dance model ie the lockdown model which is estimated to bring down the caseload by 25-30% the lockdown model basically means buying time to prepare the vaccine to kill the virushowever the lockdown has certain critical economic consequences which add to the burden of global distress this can be explained using the standard macroeconomic keynesian model the lockdown and the spread of the disease have a direct negative shock on aggregate consumption levels and exports this leads to a contraction in aggregate demand which leads to a fall in the market rate of interest and aggregate equilibrium output the secondary effect on the commodity market is via investment demand function which can either increase owing to a fall in the market rate of interest or fall owing to the contraction in aggregate demand clearly the contraction of the aggregate demand-side generates an economic slowdown on the other hand restriction of workers gathering in the workplace owing to lockdown hurts the production in those sectors which need the presence of physical workers note that software or financial service-producing sectors are exempted from such negative supply shock at least in the short-run to medium-run since those works could be easily carried out based on “work from home” anthem however reverse migration of workers is an indication of a sharp cut down in production activities this aggregate supply shock leads to the situation of stagflation in recent announcements by the reserve bank of india (rbi) to ease liquidity in the system may prove to be counterproductive provided the aggregate supply shock since the escalation of demand specifically for non-traded products without an adequate increase in production (supply) would only result in inflation in other words supply-side management must go hand in hand with demand-side policies even if policies are undertaken at the national level by the government however conditions may not improve much due to shocks in the external sector through trade in commodities most imports are banned which will increase the economic cost of production of import substitutes within the domestic territory based on the theory of comparative advantage in a ricardian sense at the same time exports are hurt due to lower demand from the developed economies this shows that unemployment and inflation are inevitable in the near futurecorona virus has mainly affected raw material export-driven countries with the covid-19 virus in the backdrop there will be a decline in new orders production and employment with ease in supplier deliveries as demand will be less with a mild decline in the inventories there has been a huge revenue impact long stretches of empty supermarket shelves and shortage of essential commodities are only the visible impacts to consumers of the global chain disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic the uncertainties ahead swing between extremes as the shortages worsen before they get resolved prices of many commodities could go up for consumers even if laws exist against price gouging at the same time we should keep in mind that constrained supplies could cause a decline in demand which in turn may end up weakening prices risk management process is not robust enough to cope with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic the seemingly relentless forces of globalization and technology with coronavirus in the backdrop will present us with new supply chain challenges and opportunities for further progress in the near future there is a glimmer of good news as countries globally haven taken preventive measures but the recovery may be fragilethe crisis due to the global pandemic is likely to be more serious for developing economies compared to the global financial crisis of 2008 this is due to the fact that the global financial crisis leads to lower demand for exports from the developing economies by the developed nations which further lead to contraction of export-based industries and other sectors in the developing nations due to inter-sectoral backward and forward linkage effect however the burden of retrenchments in the formal sector was absorbed in the informal sector in the present situation the problem of vanishing informal sector is evident since informal sector workers are more vulnerable to the spread of the disease due to the absence of non-regulatory authority and out of direct government control moreover lockdown lead to massive close down of this informal units thus the informal sector in this present set up is vanishing due to which the shock absorption capacity of developing economy like india is becoming weaker the global economy is drowning towards deep cycles of economic depression and the aftershocks seem to be long-lasting the only way of this global shock seems to be international policy coordination in line with the needs of the domestic economiesblackcoffer insights 18: anusil das stxavier's university\",\n",
              " 'covid 19 has bought the world to its knees with businesses being shut travel being banned schools and colleges being closed we have observed an impeccable amount of sorrow and despise along with a great amount of mental torture and destruction though situations are improving now and the lockdowns are being lifted it is a fact that it cannot be shunned that this virus will have a long term impact on people and the effects will not only be felt economically and physically but also mentallywe’ve been reading articles regarding the impact of covid 19 on the economy education mental health and every other possible aspect but one topic which has not been talked about much is the impact of covid 19 on office space and co-working industries well it is quite obvious that offices will start functioning now but the covid period hasn’t ended this means that social distancing will also have to be followed in offices; where it will be a problem to do so because of the lack of adequate infrastructure and space the same will be the condition in co-working industries wherein employees of different companies come and work together under the same roofhowever these problems are quite obvious (though people haven’t thought about them much) but the fact which people fail to notice and understand is that the meaning of space is not only limited to infrastructural space which is measured in square foot or square meters; but it also extends to metal space or for that fact space in the minds of people for others and their thoughts as well as opinionscoronavirus has left a big scratch in our country; just the way a car needs repair after an accident our country will also need repair after the control of this virus but unlike a car our country will require a large amount of time to get restored and to stand straight without any supportneedless to say the economic stability of our country will definitely be hit because of this reason but the problem is since the earnings of the employers will reduce it will subsequently lead to a drop in the salary of the employees while some employees might be preferred by their bosses and may receive a raise regularly others might be subjected to unfair treatment and made to do the same amount of work for a lower salarypeople tend to overlook the thin line which exists between cooperation and competition the problem doesn’t arise when such a situation happens wherein an employee is getting paid more than the other but instead it arises when people start to compare their earnings as well as benefits to that of others and in today’s world where people keep money at the top of their priority list comparisons will play a very important role in the performance of employees and their companysince there will exist inequalities and partialities in companies there will also exist a sense of hatred and competition among the employees of the same company; who will compete to get a better position or a raise in their salary this may seem beneficial to some as it might compel the employees to work harder and better but however will bring huge losses in the long run the fact is; employees might end up doing unethical acts which will help them to make a better impression in their boss’s eyesmoreover since there will be comparisons among the employees it might happen that the ‘employee of the month’ ends up being hated by all other employees in the company another situation that might arise is that of bluffing and pretending; wherein employees tend to show that they work very hard but they don’t this might be practiced by showing the boss that they are working when he is on around and then chilling the rest of the time when the boss goes home or sits in his office in fact employees might also lose interest in working if they sense repeated partialities and inequalities; which they might show by quitting the jobs or not performing to their bestsuch situations will definitely arise in companies and offices; wherein employees will compete for attention and resources; which will have a great impact on the company and its functioning and all this will happen because of only one thing; lack of office mental space ie space in the minds of people working together in a particular office for cooperation and teamwork along with ignorance of the fact that things will get better and eventually the same after some timeanother kind of industry and companies that will be affected due to the long-lasting impact of covid 19 is the co-working industry and offices this is because there will be a shortage of resources and the income of people but the maintenance cost to be born for the infrastructure as well the rent will remain the same because of this employees will be told by the company owners to exploit the resources present in the offices and use them to the fullest; to compensate for the losses being born and to make better use of the money being used however the number of resources will be the same and so there will be a case of competition between employees of different companies to use resources and take benefits of the sameif the above two situations happen to occur at the same time (which they most likely will) we will observe a scene of intra-company as well as inter-company competition also our personal relations with other employees in the company might also be affected due to this comparison and competition; which itself will be a result of limited mental spacecovid 19 will have severe impacts on the office (mental) space of companies and people\\xa0 people’s thoughts how they treat others along with accepting defeat and rejection will be an important aspect of everyone’s lives moreover we might also observe a shoot in the intensity and frequency of office people going to psychologists; because of repeated rejection and unfair treatment however we need to cope with this thing and realize that it is indeed very important for us to start preparing to expand our mental space and that this competition and comparison will not stay for long and should not affect our personal relations and life at any costblackcoffer insights 18: archit khandelwal shishukunj international school indore',\n",

web-streaming industries fitness and teleconference apps have boomed during this pandemic industries like tourism fast-food industry retail and leisure sectors have suffered the worst hit due to coronavirus impactduring this lockdown to prevent the spreading of coronavirus impact almost all of the companies have adopted a work-from-home culture and have used various teleconference apps to hold meetings teleconference apps are also being used by college institutions and universities so that the studies don’t get disrupted also confined to their homes people have started engaging more in fitness apps and web streaming services like netflix youtube and amazon prime are at their zenithwhile these industries are thriving in this pandemic the most affected industry during this time is the hospitality industryhospitality industry embodies various sectors like transportation traveling airlines hotels and lodges etc hotels and traveling are also a major part of the tourism industry the tourism and hospitality industries may appear somewhat similar but they have their subtle distinctions tourism mainly involves traveling and services to those who are away from home the hospitality industry involves businesses and services that are concerned with leisure and enjoyment and mainly run on customer experience and satisfaction their customers may also be local inhabitants along with touriststhe hospitality industry can be majorly divided into accommodations travelling and food and drinks accommodations include hotels resorts hostels motels etc the best of the hotels and resorts that were basking at their peeks now have no option but to lay off their employees many hotels are down to zero occupancies and have led to an immense loss for the hotel establishments the same is the case for resorts hostels motels etc that provide accommodations since there are no occupants there is no money inflow which is leading to the layoffs of employees as the owners are not able to provide paychecks anymorebusinesses in the accommodation sector that have just started are finding it difficult to cope up with this situation various governments have extended small business bridge loans to cope up with this situation the accommodations sector has no other way to cope with this situation but to wait for the situation to improve so that they can improve their businesstraveling

from march to may are said to be the busiest times of the year for the tours and travel industry but people are reluctant to travel in the fear of catching coronavirus or getting stuck abroad if the governments announce restrictions thereby overstaying their visas that can imply their future travels abroad airlines and tourism agencies have stopped marketing and advertising as it would be irresponsible and does not make sense during this crisisto cope up with this situation airlines like virgin atlantic and american airlines have started deploying passenger flights to carry cargo while various airlines have laid off commercial travel has dropped tremendously also there is a recent drop in jet fuel prices it is being estimated that many airlines are going to go bankrupt if this situation persistsapart from airlines the cruise industry and travel agencies also take a toll this year they are facing cancellations of bookings and some new travel agencies are at a risk of closing down rendering all their employees either losing their jobs or going on unpaid leaves in this time of crisisit is predicted that once the pandemic is over or the situation is under control the travel and tour industry can take about 10 months to return to normalcy however this outbreak may affect the entire tourism industry’s futuremany foods and drinks services fall under the hospitality industry as they offer people services that provide them leisure time their customers not only include tourists but locals passerby’s etc these mainly include restaurants tea and coffee shops bars and pubs catering etccatering is provided at places mainly where there is a social gathering to deliver food and drinks services where it is not provided or not according to the organizer’s preference due to this pandemic many countries are in lockdown and even those that are not in lockdown are not allowed to hold public gatherings as a safety precaution due to the avoidance of public gatherings and events to maintain social distancing catering services are halted for nowrestaurants tea and coffee shops pubs and bars have all closed down not only for the safety of their customers but also keeping in mind the safety of their employees and workers however a few restaurants that offer food delivery are still working by taking all the necessary health and sanitation precautions to prevent the spreading of coronavirus the number of such restaurants seems to be declining with the increasing cases of covid-19 as the customers are becoming more and more afraid and cautious about the situation though quick-service food deliveries can cope better than the full-service restaurants during this crisisbecause of this unprecedented crisis all these industries that are being affected are hoping for government support to make it through such tough times without some financial support or help from the government or other institutions it will be difficult for various establishments to survive

              " 'the hospitality sector in india has witnessed unprecedented deceleration this year in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic the indian hotel sector has been hit hard tussling with significantly low demand with very few future bookings since the outbreak of covid-19 companies have been canceling interviews at the top hotel management colleges in india the overall hiring sentiment in the country is witnessing a negative impact in the short term with 60-65 percent of interviews getting postponed especially in the hospitality services sector following the slowdown across industries triggered by the coronavirus pandemic even the students who were aspiring for a career in the hospitality industry are on the verge of full swing currently with the imposition of section 144 there are barely any bookings being made for the future and the current ones all stand canceled in this scenario there is limited scope for quick revivalit’s proud to see that this sector shows its maturity level: in working together showing their true hospitality commitments in helping out our society where they can for example by making their venue available for hospital beds and hospital employees the situation we are in also brings new business models and opportunities in defining for instance new delivery concepts human capital sharing platforms initiatives in promoting the “staycation or holiday concept” and the use of the less productive time to work on activities that were normally pushed forward like asset counts security plans defining standard operating procedures social media plans etcwhat has caused the panicthis may seem obvious but it’s worth looking at this a bit closer the main reason there was such widespread panic was that the government announced its advice to avoid public meeting places like restaurants bars and pubs without simultaneously announcing a complete ban or a plan to support the businesses whose revenue streams they’d just denied many of these businesses operate on low margins and very fragile cash flow already so the prospect of survival for an indefinite period of time without income seemed very bleak indeed this has taken a mental toll on already stressed business owners and their worried stafffacts & figures – coronavirus effect on the hospitality:the impact of the novel coronavirus on india’s hospitality sector jobs is nothing short of severe while most economists expect things to rebound in the latter half of the year uncertainty still lurks a sheer job trauma is staring at the hospitality industry in the near future this is as the chances of losing a job are at high risk furthermore the entry-level has postponed the hiring for the near future let us check here some of the facts concerning the drop in the

anywhere between us$ 885 billion to us$ 10 billion reflecting an erosion of 39% to 45% compared to last yearbesides the actual business loss the hotel owners will also incur losses due to fixed

plan for re-opening and utilizing this period to fix and upgrade whatever is possible another step is where all the action is required by the sector once the outbreak of the virus is contained and the world is set to travel again it is suggested that any plan of re-opening must be done keeping long-term benefits and safety compliances in mind it is imperative that hospitality companies reach out to

international monetary fund (imf) has predicted a shrink of 3% in the global gdp indicating the extent of the crisis the severity of the issue is being felt by various big companies in india and other major powers of the world in an interview anand mahindra ceo of m&m group said that the manufacturing and production sector has been hit the hardest with the lack of labor force he mentioned the lack

more than the combined output of both germany and japanthe manufacturing sector is one of the worst-hit by the pandemic china the world’s largest exporter of goods and the epicenter of the covid-19 pandemic has seen a significant fall in output in the first two months of 2020 chinese industrial production has fallen by 135% and major manufacturers in china are facing problems relating to the

the manufacturing and construction sectors were negative outliers the government in order to recuperate announced a plethora of decisions the government cut the corporate tax from 30% to 22% and for manufacturing enterprises from 25% to 15% in order to strengthen the position of public sector banks the government announced the merger of 10 public sector banks into 4the government also announced a fiscal stimulus of 17 lakh crores inr stepping over its fiscal deficit target in order to drive the economy out of the downward spiral and get it on the path of growth giving lubricant to an economy facing liquidity crunch with heightening npabut the coronavirus outbreak halted the economic activity and posed government the issue of fulfilling the basic survival needs of workers in the informal sector in the wake of massive urbanization the daily wage earners tried to walk down to their native places in huge numbers posing immense difficulty for the government\\xa0apart from that the domestic equity market indices- the bse sensex and nse nifty crashed which reflected the erosion of investor confidence and reflected stealth of bearish sentiment around the worldall this amalgamated together posed a serious question on the survival of a huge chunk of the indian population and invited a lot of criticism for the governmentthis is when the central nda government announced a fiscal relief package: the central government announced a fiscal stimulus of additional inr 17 lakh crores that constitutes approximately 08% of india’s gdp under pradhan mantri gareeb kalyan yojna this fiscal stimulus is used to target the underprivileged section of the society instead of conventional indirectly lubricating the economy through deficit financingthe government under the nfsa-national food security act has decided to provide an additional 5 kg of indian staple wheat and rice and 1 kg of pulses every month to people with ration cards the government is expanding and accelerating the dissemination of unilateral transfers under various government schemes\\xa0 under pm kisan scheme an indian farmer receives payment of inr 6000 in three installments every year out of 6000 the goi had

lakh health workers in government hospitals inclusive of asha workers medical sanitary workers and paramedicsthe finance minister nirmala sitaraman also pointed out that increased money supply combined with the dollar swap with the usa will help curb the inflammatory effect alsoshaktikanta das the rbi chief announced a monetary relief package for the economy that seemed to regain investor confidence as the national stock indices rallied the following are the elements of the package:the repo rate is the rate at which the commercial banks can avail loans from rbi the rbi cut repo rate by 75 basis points from 515% to 44% this reduction in the cost of borrowing from rbi gives commercial banks an incentive to enjoy increased margins by borrowing at a relatively lower rate than past and investing at the same rate ie by granting loans to businesses and householdscut in reverse-repo rate by 25 basis points from 4% to 35% the reverse repo rate is the rate at which banks can park their funds with the rbi this primarily implies the reduction in the interest rate the banks can earn by parking their funds with the rbi this incentivizes them to lend but given the commercial bank’s acquaintance with the friction caused by erosion of consumerism due to fear of covid-19; it is hard to forecast how successful the aforementioned steps arethe rbi also announced a moratorium or a provision to defer payments of emi’s on home car and credit card dues for a period of 3 months from 1st march-31st may the government also provided for interest-free loans for the msme sector to meet their working capital requirements after the lockdown has been upliftedthe rbi also announced a refinancing window for inr 50000 crores for financial institutions like nabard national housing bank and sidbias the markets crashed the foreign institutional investors withdrew their investments from the indian market increasing the demand for usd and increasing the supply of inr causing the rupee to depreciate the currency hit the bottom low of inr 76 usd\\xa0 to prevent further erosion in the value of rupee the rbi entered into a 6-month swap agreement with the us government the deliberation to undertake a currency swap began when as a result of panic-selling the foreign exchange reserves fell around $75 billion in two weeks to $43966 billion on march 27despite tourism hospitality domestic

              " '“the more you know about the past the better prepared you are for the future”theodore rooseveltas we speak the world finds itself engulfed in one of its worst crises in recent times the global covid-19 pandemic has caused never-seen-before disruption in both public and economic life not only have factories shut down or supply chains abruptly stopped or millions of workers stranded but festivals suspended families separated across countries and public-healthcare systems put under tremendous stress such a scenario is a first-time for many but the world has been through pandemics of a similar scale and nature before and after the due struggle emerged victoriously as the more experienced amongst us would remember the sars and mers outbreaks in the early 2000s presented a similar scenario although at a much lower rate of infection yet with higher rates of morbidity going back further in time the 1918 spanish flu brought a world just out of the first world war to a standstill considered to be the worst amongst modern-era pandemics the influenza pandemic affected one-third of the world’s population and 50 million lives yet preventive measures such as social-distancing quarantine mass-vaccinations public support and restraint have proved to be successful in all such situations even being effective in occasional plague outbreaks across the world we face a similar situation today – an extremely infectious virus which has already spread globally confined people to their homes and is causing tremendous economic loss every minute economic activity remains suspended affecting both the government and the industries alike\\xa0can past similar incidents guide industries in such trying times can our governments take note of how public-policy measures adopted during the spanish flu sars and mers outbreak helped in eliminating such pandemicswhat can the government learnthe panic due to the outbreak of covid-19 and more importantly the lockdown measures to deal with it are quite similar to those during the 1918 influenza pandemic or as it is more commonly referred to as the spanish flu large cities around the world were put under strict lockdowns and businesses worldwide came to a grinding halt as large chunks of the population became bedriddenthe immediate consequences were the same as the ones observed in the past few weeks – rampant unemployment supply shortages and heavy reliance on social security systems causing a sudden strain on national economic resourcesimpact & learningsinformation & censorshipeffective and transparent communications are one of the most crucial and useful tools in disease control iran presents a great example of the damage that can be unleashed by a media-blackout secondly censorship might not be the best way to appease the masses during such times the long-term political impact of media censorship and manipulation of epidemic-related facts in china is yet to be seen still the short-term international unrest and dissent have only deteriorated international relations at the risk of quoting a cliché as well as the established streisand effect the truth always comes out no matter how many countries try to hide itisolation lockdown & distancing mechanisms workthe spanish flu spread was aggravated due to the failure of policymakers in adopting effective containment measures research shows that us cities which undertook measures to reduce contact amongst citizens in early-1918 displayed significantly lower peak death rates compared to cities that failed to or were too late to adopt disease containment policiesto quote the results from this 2007 study “consistent with this hypothesis cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic had peak death rates ≈50% lower than those that did not and had less-steep epidemic curves they also displayed lower cumulative mortality”                            1: contrasting the death rates in philadelphia v st louis during the 1918 influenza outbreak1: contrasting the death rates in philadelphia v st louis during the 1918 influenza outbreakas one might guess philadelphia was late to levy restrictions on gatherings parades and social distancing measures whereas st louis was notfrom the same study we see the definition of a popular phrase “flattening the curve” emerging – which is spreading out the rate of infection over time enabling health care systems to treat people in a staggered manner in line with available resources and to further corroborate this result the following graph from the same study shows the different trajectories followed by the disease in two cities of the ushence regardless of the multiple debunking claims of social-distancing & lockdown as an effective preventive mechanism previous epidemics have taught us that they perform a marvelous job at ‘flattening the curve’premature relaxation can be disastroussocial distancing & lockdown measures are effective only if sustained at least for a few months even after things start to improvemarkel (2007) shows the disastrous consequences that the early relaxation of bans on public gatherings in st louis had on death rates during the spanish flu the pullback of social distancing measures to pursue economic interests was premature and caused a sudden unprecedented surge in the number of deaths due to the flu 2: deaths due to the spanish flu in st louis – a wider picture the black & grey lines show the duration for which social-distancing measures were active2: deaths due to the spanish flu in st louis – a wider picture the black & grey lines show the duration for which social-distancing measures were activeanother peak in death rates was observed only in cities that had relaxed distancing measures prematurely hence it is crucial to consider this past artifact when governments compare the inconveniences to the public & damage caused to the economy due to such measures with the benefits to the nation in terms of human life saved and then make the call as to when the restrictions must be easedwhat can the industry learnthe industry has played a key role in the obscure fight against the worldwide outbreak but it faces its fair share of challenges in such unprecedented timessupply shortages due to shut-down of factories & production houses and the uncertainty of when production systems would resume to normal functioningtransport disruptions due to closure & quarantining of cities and state-borders; nation-wide lockdowns bringing all transportation to a standstill; significant disruptions in the supply-chains of most goodslabour issues with restrictions on movement come issues of labour welfare unrest and employment security this problem is even more serious if the labour force is migratory in natureglobal industries have weathered through multiple natural disasters and two epidemics of a similar scale and nature their recovery-paths have immense strategic implications for current policy-makers and offer strategic insights helping companies chart out their short-term & long-term strategies3: this graph looks at the retail sales impact of the sars epidemic in china in 2003; the earthquake tsunami and fukushima nuclear disaster in japan in 2011; and the mers epidemic in south korea in 20153: this graph looks at the retail sales impact of the sars epidemic in china in 2003; the earthquake tsunami and fukushima nuclear disaster in japan in 2011; and the mers epidemic in south korea in 2015three phases characterise the impact on the retail market in all these three cases:shockrecoverystabilizationthe paths inevitably converge to stabilization but follow different trajectories and are swayed by public perceptions and externalities as in the case of the mid-autumn festival in south korea looking at the retail sector from a micro-lens past crises show that demand trends vary amongst product categories both during and post the crisis the three categories usually follow such trends:demand trends during & post a pandemic-generated crisis4: demand trends during & post a pandemic-generated crisis4: demand trends during & post a pandemic-generated crisis[1]these three trends are a valuable tool for both large scale players and regional retailers who now have the means to prioritize and predict consumer-demand and consequently alleviate a sudden strain on the product supply chain arising out of sudden & unexpected demandschange in consumer behavioura peculiar outcome of such epidemics have been the somewhat permanent changes instilled in consumer buying trends across the inflicted regions across product categories – fresh staples see a sharp rise in their demand and product hygiene & safety standards are ranked higher up in the consumers’ priority list hence the advantage lies with producers who can quickly integrate changed consumer-preferences in their products showcase product reliability & quality and priced competitively given the prevalent context lastly previous pandemics have consolidated a long-standing theory which is true not just for the retail sector but for any consumer-centric industry that there is – consumer loyalty is tried and tested during these times effective consumer relationship management (crm) can forge bonds that go a long way weathering through the thick and thin in such unprecedented timesimplicationsalmost two decades ago the sars outbreak in china had pushed entrepreneurs and established players to embrace the dawn of the e-commerce era this outbreak is expected to accelerate further the shift from conventional brick-mortar based commerce to a centralized online cloud-store based mechanism survival in the fmcg sector at least will be decided to a great extent by the breadth of the supply chain networks and the ability to overcome severe bottlenecksthe past has shown that even though established large-scale players with deep pockets and extensive networks have a likelier chance to tough it through these hard times even the regional players & smes make it through strengthened by community-support empathy and most importantly local relationshipswhat did we fail to learnthis global pandemic outbreak has made one thing painfully clear – there is a lack of global collaborative research on ways to combat the spread of such infectious diseases in the words of johan neyts professor of virology and president of the belgian-based international society for antiviral research (isar) health authorities failed to incorporate the learnings of the sars outbreak of the early 2000s partly because of the economic crisis of 2008 which squeezed funds from any potential research that could have been undertaken and partly because of the lack of seriousness in authorities in considering the efforts involved in dealing with the future expected breaks of coronavirus due to its seven different strains in existence\\xa0the way forwardall of these lessons come with a caveat – things change with time the modes of communication have changed both information & travel is much more accessible now we have fast planes & faster internet we have better healthcare capabilities and a much better if not perfect healthcare system in 1918 people didn’t even know that a virus was causing the pandemic until much after its eradication today we already have extensive research going on for 70 different probable vaccines for the virus with a record setting pace in clinical trials and approvalswe are much better equipped than what we were 100 years ago and at the same time somewhat under-equipped to deal with it but these lessons from the various similar crises that humanity has faced and risen from act as a glimmer of hope in these dire times and if put to good use can aid in the fight against covid-19 in the words of howard markel “there’s never been a better time in human history to have a pandemic than today

              " 'the current topic that is burning the world alive is the deadly coronavirus let us first understand what this coronavirus actually is according to the world health organization (who) the coronavirus disease which is called the covid-19 is an infectious disease which is caused by the newly discovered coronavirus the covid-19 virus is a virus that affects different people of the world in different ways the covid-19 disease is a respiratory disease and most of the infected people will develop mild to moderate symptoms and recover without even requiring special treatment\\xa0 the people who already have underlying medical conditions and those people who are over 60 years old have a higher risk of developing severe disease and deathcommon symptoms include:fevertirednessdry coughother symptoms include:shortness of breathaches and painssore throatand very few people in the world will report diarrhea nausea or a runny nosethe people living in this world who have only mild symptoms of this deadly disease but are otherwise healthy should self-isolate and contact their medical provider or a covid-19 information line for advice on testing and referral the people who have a fever cough or difficulty breathing should call their doctor and seek medical attentionsome key lessons from the deadly disease coronavirus: in the last 3 months there has been a drastic change to human life all around the world the coronavirus outbreak happening in the world is no more just an epidemic but it is also considered as a global pandemic now the people everywhere in the world are being asked to stay home and stay away from other people so as to reduce the risk of infectionthe deadly disease coronavirus has brought with it a wave of negative outcomes terrible illness and death but at the same time it has also highlighted some important life lessons some of them are as follows:1 you should be willing to trade some of your freedom for the greater good of the public: there is no doubt for anyone that it has been difficult for everyone in the world to stay at home many people complaining about feeling bored and aimless some people may even have the feeling that it is a breach of their individual rights being made to stay home however when it comes to the greater good one should always be willing to sacrifice a little bit of that freedom a balance between individual rights and public safety is an ever-changing thing trade a little bit of your freedom for the greater good of the public2 you should wash your hands whether there’s a virus or not: general hygiene is always important not just when there is a virus you should know the drill by now wet your hands lather them with soap scrub for 20 seconds rinse off dry with a clean towel washing hands on a regular basis are really the best way to keep safe because soap is a very effective way to kill viruses3 working from home should be an option for many: in this time of the global outbreak of the coronavirus disease many people have learned that their jobs were possible to do from home most jobs have a certain amount of work that can be done remotely without the virus in place there should still be some system in place that will promote work-life balance4 taking that sick day from the work could save lives: if you are feeling sick at any day in this situation it is highly beneficial that you just stay home it is a common feeling among lots of people that their office environment does not encourage taking sick days many people want to appear like martyrs to their managers this mentality needs to stop if you are sick just stay home5 the internet should be a basic right: according to a study done by the university of birmingham the right to internet access also known as the right to broadband should be considered a human right many people from all over the world are unable to get online particularly the people who live in developing countries and so they lack meaningful ways to influence the global players shaping their everyday lives in addition to this during times like these it is especially important to be able to contact family friends and work from home if necessary the internet is the only way to do so6 the doctors and the researchers need to be paid better: if this scary time has taught us anything it’s that doctors and researchers will be the ones who get us out of this mess the doctors and the researchers are the only ones who are working day and night to drive the recovery of the world at the moment hundreds of scientists scramble to find a coronavirus treatment it is high time for us that we need to re-evaluate how much money hollywood actors pro-athletes and politicians make and instead pay the scientist and the doctors the salary they deserve7 everyone should know how to cook: the situation that has forced everyone to stay at home has forced many people to learn re-learn or re-ignite their love for cooking learning how to cook is to have one of the most important skills in life you depend on yourself it teaches you self-sustainability and you save a lot of money these days hundreds of people sharing social media posts of their delicious meals they are re-discovering the wonders of eating in8 the importance of talking to friends every day: now that we can’t go out and keep busy the best way to combat loneliness is to be in regular contact with friends and family by chatting over the phone or video chatting this is the time to have long talks and deep conversations don’t forget human connection during these crucial times call your grandma9 learn to appreciate nature: if you live near a spacious outdoor area like the desert or an empty road lined with trees and you realize it is the only safe surface-less space to take a walk in then you start to realize how beautiful nature actually is the point is not to remain indoors but to avoid being in close contact with others when you do leave your home whether it is for a walk in the desert or a run on your street make sure to wipe down any surfaces with which you come into contact and at the same time also avoid touching your face and frequently wash your hands10 learn how to be content alone: it is so hard for some people to just be still and do nothing being alone especially for extroverts can be exhausting and lonely social distancing can be very difficult but it can also teach you a lot about yourself you learn how to keep yourself busy your body and mind is your home and you have to learn how to love it and live with itconclusion: it is rightly said that it is important to learn from the past the deadly coronavirus disease that is taking the lives of so many people across the world has taught so many life lessons to the people living in it these lessons are not meant to be forgotten but are to be remembered by human beings in order to make the earth a beautiful place to live in lastly i would like to conclude by mentioning that “stay at home stay safe save lives”blackcoffer insights 17: snehasish\\xa0ghosh darrang college assam',\n",

              " 'india has been beset by financial scams since independence every 4-5 years indian citizens hear about so many trillions of public money being misappropriated and eventually lost by people who the public is supposed to start in this article with examples i would like to point out that there are two factors to scams like nirav modi: the complicity of actors within the financial industry and the systemic loopholes in an emerging financial system that has been used for scams like nirav modithe first financial scam of independent india was found in 1958 when feroze gandhi mp found that in 1957 haridas mundhra got the government-owned life insurance corporation (lic) to invest rs 124 million (about us$32 million at the time) in the shares of six troubled companies of whom mundhra held a large number of shares which he was trying to boost by rigging the market the investment was done under governmental pressure and bypassed the lic’s investment committee which was informed of this decision only after the deal had gone through in the event lic lost most of the money several leading stockbrokers who were on the lic investment committee testified that the investment could not have been made for the purpose of propping up the market as was claimed by the finance ministry and that had the lic consulted the investment committee they would have pointed out mundhra’s forged shares episode from 1956 the finance minister t t krishnamachari in his testimony tried to distance himself from the lic decision implying that it may have been taken by the finance secretary but justice mc chagla held that the minister is constitutionally responsible for the action taken by his secretary and he disowns his actions eventually krishanamachari had to resign the nehru government suffered considerable loss of prestige in the incidentthe 1992 indian stock market scam was a stock market scam orchestrated by harshad mehta the scam took place in mumbai and was the biggest market scam of india the 1992 scam was a systematic stock fraud using bank receipts and stamp paper which caused the indian stock market to crash the scam lead to a complete structural change of the security system of india and introduced a completely new system of stock transactions the 1992 scam exposed the indian financial systems through the inherent loopholes of the system this scam led to the reform of the security system of india and introduced online security systems the scam was orchestrated in such a way that mehta secured securities from the state bank of india against

owned in these companies the 1992 scam raises many questions which involved many bank officials responsible for collusion with mehta the 1992 scam caused an investigation through which many officials were implicated in fraudulent charges the security system of india took a rapid reform in its fundamental structure post the 1992 scam the first major structural change was the formation of the national stock exchange of india (nse) the first major reform in the financial sector of india was the formation of the cii code for desirable corporate governance developed by rahul bajaj post-1992 a new regulatory board known as the securities and exchange board of india was formed to monitor the national stock exchange and the national securities depository there were structural changes in the equity market the government introduced ten acts of parliament and one constitutional amendment based upon the principles of economic reform and legislative change for the equity market the nse introduced online trading in 1994 which changed the dynamics of stock buying and selling the capital market now opened up nationally as opposed to being confined in mumbai the exchange system started functioning based on satellite communications that abolished geographical barriersin 2001 ketan parekh purchased large stakes in less known small market capitalization companies and jacked up their prices through circular trading with other traders and collusion with these companies and large institutional investors this resulted in steep hikes in share prices it later transpired that promoters and industrialists often gave parekh funds to artificially rig up their share prices this set of ten stocks was colloquially referred to as “k-10” stocks and parekh was playfully referred to as “pentafour” the rbi commenced an investigation against parekh around the same time a bear cartel of brokers in mumbai opposed to parekh tried to dump their shares of k-10 stocks panicking parekh sold off his entire ownership of the so-called k-10 stocks that he had successfully jacked up over the past two years this resulted in a stock market crash the next day resulting in large-scale losses for large institutional investors including insurance companies and mutual funds a 30 member joint parliamentary committee (jpc) investigation ensued which found that parekh had been involved in circular trading throughout the time period from and with a variety of companieswhen the securities exchange board of india (sebi) started scanning an entire spectrum of ipos launched over 2003 2004 and 2005 it ended digging up more dirt and probably prevented a larger conspiracy to hijack the market it involved the manipulation of the primary market—read initial public offers (ipos)—by financiers and market players by using fictitious or benaami demat accounts they then transferred the shares to financiers who sold on the first day of listing making windfall gains from the price difference between the ipo price and the listing price this time fraudsters targeted the primary market to make a quick buck at the expense of the gullible small investors direct participants (dps) used retail

run by saradha group a consortium of over 200 private companies that were believed to be running collective investment schemes popularly but incorrectly referred to as chit funds in eastern india it was feared that legitimate non-banking financial companies and microfinance institutions would be stigmatized leading to a vicious cycle of low depositor trust higher interest rates lower lending and a localized credit crisis because most of the saradha group depositors came from the lowest economic strata the loss of the investment would cause a further decrease in social mobility the scandal

              " 'it was 14th march and i wasaltogether prepared for my last theater competition of this very year i only knew in my core how much this competition meant for me in the morning i made some last-minute calls to my diligent team who were ceaselessly practicing for the past few days to confirm to me that they were all coming for the competition because of the alarming coronavirus ball game going outside the market it was not like i wasn’t aware of the situation but i believed that i would be able to handle it because there’s a quote in theatre that says “fear is only as deep as the mind allows” and to some length i was fearless my passion fondness and attachment for the theatre were above all the notices and announcements that we’re rolling outbut then at once i received a call from mr sandeep the head of the event who told me that the event is put off till the next few days and from that precise moment onwards the journey of hard and strenuous days began and it in point of fact felt like it was all meant to happen the competition was postponed the team was stuck in their homes grudgingly time was haunting us all because of this coronavirus these were some of the cardinal ways in which this virus affected us but there was more to this sickness this very sickness acted like a sadist i was impressed as i found someone who could act better than me it has reversed the ways we used to work play and exercise and the world solution that was asked to practice by the professionals were social distancing this virus was wild and dangerous towards the people who are in declining health conditions but obviously it could not take off his hands from the young people as well the coronavirus cases and deaths were heightening to a great extent also the major problem that came in the light was people being fully unprepared and this led to the public becoming snappier intolerant and non-supportive needless to say as this virus was acting like a sadist but by all means our government knows how to best handle the affairs they decided to shut down schools colleges bars anything that would involve the gathering of more than 10 people with disinformation coming from all around related to this infection it becomes hard to judge for the audience what is true and what is false and it worsens when the public consumes this information by working from home this virus was not only hollowing people from deep inside but was also supporting and increasing some other country-related issues one of which is fake news which is a serious problemwith fake news traveling around the world people come and start to blabber people start offering numerous solutions and want that most of the people should follow it they start acting like saints who know all the solutions to this pandemic some of the solutions are convenient to follow but some are not and are unhealthy which creates immense confusion and arguments but the best way to stop the confusion and to avoid these people is to avoid their arguments and to not convince them with your points because it is rightly said a man convinced against his will is of the same opinions still the thing to do is to look after your family and to avoid shady and deceitful peoplebut one thing that can’t be avoided is our expanding and maturing industries that lend a hand in developing our nation but no power to choose is left with our industries but to be at a standstill in this current moment as coronavirus right now is winning the game the untold number of industries is growing down and a major one is our tourism industries and if this continues to happen then in no time there will be a loss to jobs close to more than 75 million many working people like in the tourism industry and not only in this peculiar industry but also in various others people are getting suspended because of a hefty amount of lost revenue one of my own family members resorted to this issue by working for free for the next few months in order to at least protect her job who should be blamed for these kinds of situations is also a point of concern for many people“massive hunger will definitely kill the poor before this virus” this statement takes my immediate attention what options are left with the daily-wage earners i would say no option they are the ones who are in the most condemning situations lockdown for us can be a way to relax or listen to karaoke but lockdown for them means an end to their life unquestionably this decision by our prime minister is the best he could take but when the best turns out to be the worst for someone then i think it’s a moment to question going to the internet and writing what’s the best way to spend this quarantine should definitely be what’s the best way in which we can help people but naturally this would not interest many people furthermore this set off to become more hell when people start with the activity of stockpiling unnecessary piling of food is altogether a reason for shortage and ultimately hungermy maid mala who is a housewife and has a small suffering family i believe could have written this article in a better manner if she would have the relevant education because she is the actual prey to this problem she being the patient will exactly know the impact this virus can have on our lives because sitting in our homes with a cup coffee can never let us know what an empty cup feels like mala said to me think how much we would be tolerating that our prime minister apologized to the public for this lockdown which was certainly a good thing for the masses what all i could do to help her was to provide her family with some money and eatables a small contribution with some motivation and a call once in 2 days i believe will not improve her state completely but would certainly provide her with the power to deal with it  not only mala and her family but there are also millions of people who are in the exact same condition there are countless mala in our country who are panicking enduring and suffering each night with no food in their stomachs imagine an exact same situation for yourselves it would without fail be the hardest situation this is the impact a virus can create for sure this article can be of endless pages owing to the fact that there are more stories to to this and each story ispainful that the otherlabor chowk in noida has numerous stories of people conveying their problems and asking for help this chowk is in the main know for men looking for work quite a few men gather there each morning to get some work in order to feed their families with at least a roti but this virus even snatched that from their plates a very known movie in our indian cinemas is “coolie” that says these laborers should get their pay till their sweat dries up these people anyhow need money each day to feed their families but after these uncontrollable situations they at times are forced to eat filth and muck and this sickness might not kill these people but hunger and stained water definitely will these stories will never end because it’s all meant to happen but i hope this situation does in order to provide some relief to themalso how one would imagine that the movie “six feet’s apart” would be acted in reality the solutions related to this pandemic came swiftly and rapidly with the help and support of your doctors and nurses who all were serving us and the sufferers round-the-clock solutions like washing your hands for at least 20 seconds correctly covering your mouth with a face mask and majorly avoiding unnecessary wandering on the streets and keeping yourself away from unhygienic people were asked to follow the efforts of our doctors nurses government officials made me realize that my passion should not be above these notices and announcements but should move hand in hand with it right at this moment we all are moving with these circumstances and nobody knows what might happen in the future but one thing is of sure that nobody can ever forget this situation and indeed me as it had the ability to knock down my event that day many lessons were learned by all the world in these days some being that never ever take anything for granted because if that thing or that person leaves then life tends to become like a rock appreciate admire and cherish whatever you have because you never know when it might leave you ask from them who have just lost someone from this corona virus moments to live happily in this world are very few spend it with someone who makes you feel loved each day sun rises with a new hope to make a habit to feel the warmth and wish for a healthy life for yourself your family and this world together we all are fighting this virus with unityblackcoffer

treatments for covid-19 however there are many ongoingclinical trials evaluating potential treatmentsthe first case of this pandemic in india wasreported on january 30th2020 after which it has increasedsubstantially around the country to such an extent that the indian primeminister announced a 21-day lockdown around the countryrating agencies both global and domestic are unanimous that the covid-19 pandemic will be an economic tsunami for india even though the country may not slip into a recession unlike the eurozone the us or asia-pacific that have stronger trade ties to china analysts believe the impact on india’s gdp growth will be significant the fallout of the move will spill over to the financial year 2021 which begins on april 1 moody’s investors service on march 27 sharply slashed its projection for india’s gdp growth in the calendar year 2020 from 53% to 25% the markdown was the second in 10 days and came after prime minister narendra modi announced the 21-day lockdown

people like mr alam and mr kumar who are part of india’s unorganized informal industry that employs 94% of the population and contributes 45% to its overall output this industry is already bearing the brunt of the lockdown with thousands of finding themselves unemployed overnight “no-one will be allowed to go hungry” finance minister nirmala sitharaman said while announcing the package – a combination of direct cash transfer benefits and food security measuresbut the economic fallout of this unprecedented lockdown has been dire businesses have closed unemployment has risen and productivity has fallen india’s growth engine was actually sputtering well before the threat of the outbreak arrived once one of the fastest-growing economies in the world its growth slowed to 47% last year – the lowest level in six yearsunemployment was at a 45-year high last year the industrial output from the eight-core sectors at the end of last year fell by 52% – the worst in 14 years small businesses had only just begun to recover from the controversial 2016 currency ban that came as a body blow to the cash-consuming informal economy now experts say the coronavirus outbreak is likely to further cripple the already frail economythere is little finance minister nirmala sitharaman and rbi governor shatikanta das can do if covid-19 forces a virtual lockdown of commercial hubs in india like it had done in china and has in italy lights out in mumbai and delhi alone the nerve centers of india will cause great damage to the indian economy indeed covid-19 can be a massive blow to the slowing indian economy particularly small business the sme sector which had recently shown improvement since demonetization took placethis is a war-like situation for the indian economy as the malls and theatres are empty schools are shut for contingencies and some states have even announced a complete shutdown of all services so while most welcome the government’s measures they feel much more is needed to be done to minimize the economic impact “while free extra rations have been sanctioned how will the poor access what is due to them” wonders economist arun kumar“the government shoulddevise a way of using the army and state machinery to physically distributefood to the poor” with thousands of migrant workers stuck miles away fromtheir homes the seamless distribution of cash and food needs to be thegovernment’s top priority he adds and it’s not just migrant workers at riskfarmers are also vulnerable to a potential economic shock from the lockdown –the agriculture industry contributes nearly $265bn to gdp thegovernment says it will give farmers 2000 rupees ($30) in april as an advancepayment from an $80 annual pay-out to tide over the situation“this money will be inadequate because exports have stopped pricesin cities will rise because of profiteering and in rural areas they will dropbecause farmers won’t be able to sell their crop” says economist arunkumar the outbreak has happened at a critical farming time – the new crop isready waiting to be sold economists warn india’s challenge will be in transporting this food fromvillages to cities in the midst of the lockdown if supply chains don’t workproperly a lot of food will be wasted and lead to massive losses for indianfarmers experts warn that india is also at the brink of a major unemploymentcrisis economist vivek kaul says people who work for small businesses may endup with job and salary losses “i know of places where companies areactively discussing how many people they need to fire” he says and that’snot all while no sector is immune to covid-19 disruption some are more vulnerable the tourism industry will see greater disruptions the world travel and tourism council calculated that tourism generated 92% of the gdp and supported 42673 million jobs tourism dependent states like kerala karnataka earn huge forex but if the disease continues many operators will be forced to go out of the businessin the exports industry while the gloom and doom surrounding covid-19 are palpable the crisis might also throw up some great opportunities for india there are already reports of several western manufacturers looking at moving their factories out of china many indian chemical producers have gone on record at having received inquiries from western manufacturers who earlier never used to look towards india as a source tapping these opportunities however will require some serious innovation on the policy front indian policymakers need to hunker down and plan economic assistance that

particularly for the disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the societywhat can the corporates dothe crisis is a story with an uncertain ending however what is clear that the covid-19 has introduced

stages epitomize the inescapable of our time: the battleagainst covid-19 is one that leaders today must win in order to find an economicallyand socially feasible path to the next normalwhat can the government dothe government should consider certain measures in order to manage the pandemic the following steps and the recognition of the likely scenarios for the indian economy can enable policymakers to identify appropriate countermeasures to stem the spread of the pandemic:build a national database of the reachable physical health infrastructure and medical and para-medical resources the public and private health care facilities can be segregated by labeling a section of accessible hospital beds for treating covid-19 patients only extend additional one-time budgetary support to augment the public health care system in terms of facilities equipment and human resources capacity earmark financial resources to provide one-time grantsfinancial support to research institutions and leading pharmaceuticalbiotechnologymedical equipment companies extend the coverage of ayushman bharat and other applicable insurance schemes to covid-19 if not already included tweak the existing customs duty structure for select components which are essential for manufacturing testing kits ventilators etcenable access to funds for businesses to run their day to day operations and service their debt ensure the smooth supply of essential products and commodities to contain the economic impact of the covid-19 outbreak provide credit support to medium and small enterprises encourage investments such as one-time set off of capital investments made by corporates for income-tax computationstherefore the question remains whether the stimulus is enough or not – both quantitatively and qualitatively would it be able to help the economy absorb the shock of the lockdown compared to what the usa (2 trillion usd) germany (610 billion usd) uk (424 billion usd) france (335 billion usd) spain (218 billion usd) china (788 billion usd) and italy (273 billion usd) the spending by india (1 70000 crore – 225 billion usd) may prima facie appear to be insufficient however such a comparison is not easy and straightforward because a lot of factors are to be taken into account in addition the important factor that needs to be considered is whether at this point in time the country is able to spend more than this or not against a revised budget estimate of rs 2163000 crore for 2019-20 towards tax collections the collection as on 31st\\xa0dec 2019 was to the tune of rs 1383000 crore only with a clearly huge shortfall in addition a substantial amount would also have to be spent now to tackle the pandemic which is of utmost priority on top of it huge additional spending would jeopardize the fiscal deficit discipline although at times of emergency fiscal deficit should not be a matter of concern at all\\xa0it would also have to be seen how long this virus continues to affect india and going by the hygiene standard and herd mentality that we have the virus continues to affect us beyond 3 months and extends to 6-8 months quite obviously these packages would be grossly insufficient and more money will have to be pumped into the economy if the need arises currency notes will have to be printed and circulated and concerns about higher fiscal deficit should be simply pushed to the backseat the corporate sector and a section of large-hearted people have also come forward at this time of distress to support the government initiatives in fighting this menace which should provide some financial comfort to the governmentthe pandemic has appeared from nowhere as a potential death knell to the world economy which is already under stress and india is no exception there is no second opinion that this pandemic has hit the world very hard and would continue to do so in the foreseeable future whether india can emerge from the medical pandemic as well as the economic pandemic relatively unscathed remains to be seen we will have to take care of our lives as well as the livelihoods of our citizens as indians we hope we shall overcome \\xa0together we can do this and we

              " 'in today’s day and age of hyper-connectivity celebrities – dubbed by fraser and brown (2002) as people who are famous for being famous and may or may not always serve others sacrificially – live in glass houses that are open to the prying eyes of the public notification bars are ever abuzz with news about when these celebrities wake up what they wear to the gym what they eat and where they go on their vacations in the idealized and idolized eyes with which society views celebrities this unceasing visibility gives them an all-pervasive influence the dominance of celebrities in swaying opinions of their acolyte is well-established – from advertisements in the print and pixel mediums brand endorsements and integrations the evidence of exploiting celebrity influence is vast however today more than ever before this influence is creeping away from the world of consumerism and into governance policy and politics with an increasing number of public figures overtly taking strong and stronger political stances making moves charged with a political motive and eventually entering the sphere of legislature and bureaucracy the scope of having a public influence has come to mean much more than it used to thereby begging the question – how well-placed are personage in the world of politics should celebrities be allowed to join politicsthe interplay between the seemingly contrasting worlds of celebrities and policy-makers have come into increasing contact in india and the rest of the world-leading pop-music artists back presidential candidates internationally acclaimed actors attempt international diplomacy films are claimed to be vehicles of political messaging prime ministerial banquets engage celluloid stars and so on the ‘influence’ that stars exert on the world of politics seems to encapsulate an entire spectrum of involvement – at the zenith of which are the celebrities who actually set foot into parliamentary assemblies and councils to represent the public that they once only influencedalthough the phenomenon of the seeping of public influence into public policy has stretched through much of the 20th century choi and berger (2001) suggest that the celebrity-politics connect continues to strengthen much more than it did a few decades ago as we trudge further into the century of the myriad causalities that underlie this circumstance the global internet where fame isn’t restricted to the confines of tangible achievement has been theorized to be a significant driver in her 2009 book hyde labels this spectacle as a ‘mission creep’ where the enterprise of celebrities is expanding beyond its primary goalsa prodigious public following seems to be the parallel between the worlds of politics and personage which paves the path for celebrities to cross over to politics celebrities seem to be able to transition into politics with a certain grace having already learned to live in the public’s eye and established themselves allowing the carry-over of their already-known traits as celebrities into their role as policy-makers the visibility that autochthonous politicians work years to nurture celebrities already have as they descend into the political sphere in one of the best-known instances of a celebrity transitioning into politics ronald reagan walked away from hollywood and into the white house carrying with him his trademark charismatic on-screen personality that spilled over into his politics initially serving as the governor of california for 15 years in the late 1960s reagan served two terms at the oval office the voters knew who ronald was – those who closely followed the trends of the red and blue – but also those who did not giving reagan the edge that propelled him towards success on the other side of the globe india saw much the same trend as an on-screen persona aiding the creation of an off-screen political career ramanand sagar’s television series ‘ramayan’ based on the hindu mythological epic was revolutionary in the pious indian society of the 1980s when television shows were still novel it has been recounted on many an occasion that audiences would often offer their prayers to the television screen every time arun govil who portrayed the deity ‘ram’ made an appearance on screen having garnered a devout dutiful fan following govil and his other co-actors from the show turned to the world of politics where their godly association in the public’s eyes helped them make a mark even the philippines has shown ample evidence of celebrities time and again swooping in to claim political victory with their stardom and popularity that their opponents lackvery often the sentiment of anti-incumbency seems to be the golden ticket that lets celebrity politicians snatch political power from consummate politicians indeed various political theorists suggest that anti-incumbency happens to be amongst the more effective strategies to secure vote banks until 31st december 2018 ukrainian actor screenwriter and director volodymyr zelensky only played the lead in a sitcom that tells the story of a schoolteacher who accidentally becomes the president it was that winter that zelensky claimed that he was contesting the presidential elections to “change the mood and timbre of the political establishment” and to “bring professional decent people to power” zelensky took the premise of his wildly popular show from the reel to the real as he crushed rival a seasoned politician and incumbent poroshenko in a landslide victory has zelensky proved a better representative of his people than his predecessor time is yet to deliver its verdict but the gushes that he invoked in the people of ukraine and his plea to oust ‘the ruling class’ played their role in assuring zelensky 73% of the plebiscite in the early 2010s in india similar anti-incumbent sentimentalities were played into by the many celebrities including musician vishal dadlani hockey legend dhanraj pillay singer jaspinder narula and others – all of whom joined hands with arvind kejriwal’s\\xa0 ‘aam aadmi’ movement that aimed to rid the existing political system of its illsand so innumerable celebrities across countries and cultures claim the throne in fact a wikipedia page that maintains an inventory of actor-politician spanning the atlas claims that it ‘may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness’ – depicting the sheer number of celebrities who reroute to politics this begets questioning the congruence of the world of personage and that of politics\\xa0in a research article published in 1995 meyer and gamson articulated the possibility of celebrities choosing to politically address only broadly acceptable social causes because they understand their power rests with staying popular thereby failing to make any appreciable difference this seems to ring true with some celebrity politicians in india especially ones who are nominated to the upper house of the parliament but fail abysmally to leave a mark one of many such representatives is gautam gambhir a cricketer-turned-politician who has mostly been shunned for his abject performance in the parliament hema malini another popular actress who turned to politics came under heavy criticism when her claim to be a protector of women’s rights wasn’t backed by an effort to fulfill her promises owing to such instances research findings such as those by nisbett and dewalt (2016) find that the public often questions the intentions of the celebrities who venture into politics it may also seem that in entering politics and failing to deliver celebrity politicians often deprive grass-root political workers of the chance to enter the mainstream of politicshowever there is ample evidence from around the globe that goes to prove that celebrities can in fact make their mark in the world of governance independent of their primary identities take the south indian state of tamil nadu for instance where the political ethos has been consistently overshadowed by celebrities from the world of showbiz for at least the last 40 years as per data from the ministry of statistics & programme implementation tamil nadu is amongst the top-performing states in the country having the second-highest gdp most celebrities in tamil nadu who approached politics have exhibited extraordinary political will and caliber the late actor-politician j jayalalithaa or ‘amma’ ran successful terms as chief minister and is still considered a mother figure by hordes of her followers another stalwart in the landscape of tamil nadu dr mg ramachandran continues to be celebrated as one of the most influential chief ministers and is lauded for his large-scale reforms in being the forerunner of some of the changes that propelled the state towards progress including easing caste tensions and other communal violence ‘mgr’ as he is better known is remembered as much for his governance as he is for his innings on screenmore often than not celebrity engagement in politics has been used to woo voters from the younger strata of the population empirical studies such as the one by austin vord pinkleton and epstein (2008) have conclusively shown to enhance political engagement by younger voters\\xa0 along similar lines jackson (2008) found that young people are more likely to agree with political positions that are endorsed by politicians in fact many modern political theorists are of the belief that the involvement of celebrities in politics allows for otherwise uninvolved or apathetic veins of the demographic to be active participants in democracy hillary clinton aimed to do just that when she got the billboard-topping artists beyonce and jay-z to take center-stage at her rally in cleveland in the weeks leading up to the 2016 us presidential elections – in fact as multiple sources suggest this rally did see a surge in millennial supporters in such a case it might be in the benefit of the community to have more celebrities endorse and engage in politics in order to nurture a more vibrant and engaged youth\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0from our vantage point today the relationship between personage and politics seems to be a central fixture in society and is here to stay what remains to be done however is to ensure the symbiotic course of this relationship – to scrutinize and critique the celebrities who knock the doors of politics and to secure their promises of beneficence and non-maleficence to the public that it seeks to serve yet it may seem that these are benchmarks that need to be met by any and all servants of the people – celebrity or not but in the world that we live in this is certainly not the case politicians – celebrity or not largely happen upon the sphere of governance without a lot of experience backing them and learn to navigate the maze of politics on the job ultimately like all things in democracy the government is of the people and its representatives are of them and for them the eventual endorsement of its leaders – celebrity or not – can come not from data-based analyses and elaborate critique but from the people should celebrities be allowed to enter politics the question remains unanswered or rather is answered by the democratic exercise itself – with the beeps of electronic ballots election after election

              " 'frankly no the state of the public healthcare system still vast is very fragmented and cannot scale up rapidly enough to face the challenge of a pandemic such as covid-19 the origin of public healthcare lies in the british colonial period where such facilities were provided only to british officers and their families stationed in india from the 1960s onwards the independent government of india stressed more upon healthcare and it led to the creation of the modern public healthcare system in india the healthcare system is organized into primary secondary and tertiary levels at the primary level are sub centre’s and primary health centre’s (phcs) at the secondary level there are community health centre’s (chcs) and smaller sub-district hospitals finally the top level of public care provided by the government is the tertiary level which consists of medical colleges and districtgeneral hospitals the number of phcs chcs sub centre’s and district hospitals has increased in the past six years although not all of them are up to the standards set by indian public health standards but there are still critical challenges to the existing systemone of the major areas is the lack of awareness of diseases especially communicable diseases among the general population of india this challenge becomes more complicated at the lower strata of society especially poor households migrant laborers and homeless people who do not have the proper channels of communication available to get the necessary information from the health experts add low educational status poor functional literacy low accent on education within the healthcare system and low priority for health in the population among others and you see the magnitude of the problem according to a recent study initiated by the faculty and students of iit-hyderabad and iit-bombay in tier-1 cities it was found that about 12 percent of the respondents switched from public to private mode during the third week of covid-19 this modal shift was about 9 percent in tier-2 cities and about 7 percent in tier-3 cities moreover nearly 48 percent of people said that they did not travel to work during the third week of march whereas 28 percent had the same frequency of travel to work when inquired about the cancellation of trips between the cities using major modes of transportation around 18 percent said they cancelled their flights whereas 20 per cent of respondents cancelled their train journeys this indicates that awareness about covid-19 is higher in tier-1 cities in comparison with tier-2 and tier-3 cities but national level state level and door-to-door campaigns along with targeted media campaigns may enable the knowledge of the pandemic to spread fast among the local populacethe second challenge is access to public healthcare in india access (to healthcare) is defined by the oxford dictionary as “the right or opportunity to use or benefit from (healthcare)” physical reach is one of the basic determinants of access defined as “ the ability to enter a healthcare facility within 5 km from the place of residence or work” using this definition a study in india in 2012 found that in rural areas only 37% of people were able to access ip facilities within a 5 km distance and 68% were able to access out-patient facilities furthermore it was postulated that in general the more rustic (rural) one’s existence – the further one lives from towns – the greater are the odds of disease malnourishment weakness and premature deaththe third is the planning portion related to the preparedness of the pandemic planning for a pandemic such as covid-19 has never been done extensively in india as we had no recent history of such a communicable disease which spreads rapidly in crowded locations which about a quarter of the population live in the recent national lockdown called led to an increase in police violence who have not been sensitized how to deal in such a crisis and the humanitarian crisis facing migrant laborers an important part of the indian economy who have lost their jobs and facing a lack of public transport have to force to walk thousands of miles to reach their native villages the ongoing slump in the economy has been further exacerbated by the pandemic and the resultant lockdown and there have been growing complaints by healthcare professionals who are fighting in the front of this pandemic of lack of protective personal equipment’s (ppe’s) to protect themselves and their patients from covid-19 the lockdown has hit hiv+ and chronic patients hard who need constant medication to maintain their fragile condition elderly people who are often alone and have medical conditions have been left without essential support ironically these are the same group of people who are at an immediate threat from covid-19i am optimistically hoping based on the ingenious and creativity of our citizens that we tide over these tough times and fundamental

              " 'every prophet of doom unless he also happens to be a psychopath hopes that his predictions will not be borne out this is also true for the epidemiologists and virologists who have been warning the world since january that the novel sars-cov-2 virus poses a severe threat to public health around the world the name coronavirus itself is vicious enough to terrify those who otherwise are fearless in the face of any ball game tracing back the origins of the now pandemic we find that the coronavirus emerged in wuhan a city of 11 million people in china’s hubei province in late 2019 cases of the disease grew by several thousand per day in china in late january and early february the peak of the epidemic there the number of infections appearing each day has since plummeted in china making the outbreak a global pandemic that has engulfed over 214 countries around the globebesides being a health crisis the virus has already brought a major downfall in the world economy with the imf estimating the coronavirus-induced global downturn to be ‘way worse’ than financial crisis as the coronavirus spreads across the globe it appears to be setting off a devastating feedback loop with another of the gravest forces of our time: economic inequality research suggests that those in lower economic strata are likelier to catch the disease owing to their inability to meet the rising drug prices according to the international labour organization(ilo) covid-19 will have far-reaching impacts on labor market outcomes beyond the urgent concerns about the health of workers and their families the virus and the subsequent economic shocks will impact the world of work across three key dimensionsinitial ilo estimates point to a significant rise in unemployment and underemployment in the wake of the virus based on different scenarios for the impact of covid-19 on global gdp growth preliminary ilo estimates indicate a rise in global unemployment of between 53 million (“low” scenario) and 247 million (“high” scenario) from a base level of 188 million in 2019 the “mid” scenario suggests an increase of 13 million (74 million in high-income countries) though these estimates remain highly uncertain all figures indicate a substantial rise in global unemployment for comparison the global financial crisis of 2008-9 increased unemployment by 22 million while self-employment does not typically react to economic downturns it acts as a “default” option for survival or maintaining income – often in the informal economy for this reason informal employment tends to increase during crises however the current limitations on the movement of people and goods may restrict this type of coping mechanismlabour supply is declining because of quarantine measures and a fall in economic activity\\xa0at this point a preliminary estimate suggests that\\xa0infected workers have already lost nearly 30000 work months with the consequent loss of income (for unprotected workers) employment impacts imply large income losses for workers overall losses in labour income are expected in the range of between 860 and 3440 billion usd\\xa0the loss of labour income will translate into lower consumption of goods and services which is detrimental to the continuity of businesses and ensuring that economies are resilient working poverty is also likely to increase significantly\\xa0the strain on incomes resulting from the decline in economic activity will devastate workers close to or below the poverty line the growth impacts of the virus used for the unemployment estimates above suggest an additional 88 million people in working poverty around the world than originally estimated (ie an overall decline of 52 million working poor in 2020 compared to a decline of 14 million estimated pre-covid-19) under the mid and high scenarios there will be between 201 million and 350 million more people in working poverty than before the pre-covid-19 estimate for 2020who are particularly vulnerableepidemics and economic crises can have a disproportionate impact on certain segments of the population which can trigger worsening inequality\\xa0based on past experience and current information on the covid-19 pandemic and insights from previous crises a number of groups can be identified:those with underlying health conditions and older people\\xa0are most at risk of developing serious health issuesyoung persons already facing higher rates of unemployment and underemployment are more vulnerable to falling labor demand as witnessed during the global financial crisis\\xa0women\\xa0are over-represented in more affected sectors (such as services) or in occupations that are at the front line of dealing with the pandemic (eg nurses) the ilo estimates that 586 percent of employed women work in the services sector around the world compared to 454 percent of menunprotected workers including the self-employed casual and gig workers are likely to be disproportionately hit by the virus as they do not have access to paid or sick leave mechanisms and are less protected by conventional social protection mechanisms and other forms of income smoothingmigrant workers\\xa0are particularly vulnerable to the impact of the covid-19 crisis which will constrain both their ability to access their places of work in destination countries and return to their familiesthe extent and severity to which the coronavirus pandemic will impact the fight to end extreme poverty is still unknown but it is expected that the crisis will devastate the world’s most vulnerable people including the world of work the virus is already disproportionately impacting the poor in wealthy countries where the most known cases are concentrated experts are urging the world to prepare to lend extra support to low-income countries to address the pandemic covid-19 cases are more likely to go undetected or to be under-detected in developing countries that have fewer

foundation for key policy responses that focus on the crucial role of decent work in achieving a sustained and equitable recovery to mitigate the impacts of covid-19 on the world of work these standards adopted by representatives of governments workers’ and employers’ organizations provide a human-centered approach to growth and development including by triggering policy levers that both stimulate demand and protect workers and enterprisespolicy responses should focus on two immediate goals: health protection measures and economic support on both the demand- and supply-side of the associated causefirst workers and employers and their families should be protected from the health risks of covid-19 protective measures at the workplace and across communities should be introduced and strengthened requiring large-scale public support and investmentsecond timely large-scale and coordinated policy efforts should be taken to provide employment and income support and to stimulate the economy and labor demand these measures not only cushion enterprises and workers against immediate employment and income losses but they also help prevent a chain of supply shocks (eg losses in workers’ productivity capacities) and demand shocks (eg suppressing consumption among workers and their families) that could lead to a prolonged economic recessionin such challenging times many countries have come forward to protect their workers in the workplace with decisive measures to combat the spread of the disease while ameliorating its pernicious effect on the economy and labor market across the three policy pillars: protecting workers in the workplace stimulating the economy and labor demand and supporting employment and income some of the policies include working arrangements including telework; occupational safety and health (osh) advice; expanded access to paid sick leave; prevention of discrimination and exclusion while these measures will no doubt help to contain the pandemic to respond to the emergency needs it has generated and to pave the way to a gradual recovery it is clear that more needs to be done past crises and the experiences of countries which have reacted too late in the context of the current covid-19 crisis show that preparedness and early action is criticalthe coronavirus pandemic is a test it’s a test of medical capacity and political will it’s a test of endurance and forbearance for believers a test of religious faith it’s a test too of a different kind of faith in the strength of the ideas humans choose to help them form moral judgments and guide personal and social behavior the epidemic forces everyone to confront deep questions of human existence questions so profound that they have previously been answered in many different ways by the greatest philosophers it’s a test of where all humans stand what is right and what is wrong what can individuals expect from society and what can society expect of them should others make sacrifices for me and vice versa is it just to set economic limits to fighting a deadly disease how long will we stay that way and as the epidemic grows worse and brings the disease within fewer degrees of separation for everyone we may well find that the notion of loving thy neighbor as thyself becomes far more potentat last i would like to conclude by saying that covid-19 is

              " 'organizations burn a lot of resources to build one iconic image their brand is not just a picture a logo and colors; but an emotional connection with the consumer it develops by making an impression on the consumers each time they interact with the products or services and it becomes ingrained in the consumers’ minds now if it takes great efforts to build such impression recognition and trust why would a firm do something controversial that could burn their own handswe see hundreds of ads a day but only a few get noticed here is where a controversy comes into play we would definitely notice something that disagrees with our thoughts or mentally disturbs us so such ads stand out in controversy marketing a firm creates a controversy which gains them attention really quick and the word spreads widely they believe that in order to stand out they can’t play it safe always a controversial campaign could be about a social issue that could divide the masses stating political opinions or presenting something that doesn’t associate with their image etckey features of a well-crafted controversial campaign:choosing the correct subject it could be a taboo or a debatable topic while both would be controversial a taboo is more likely to draw a flack than a debatable topicthe campaign should be more focussed on the issue than on the brand itself as a result the debate would be about the issue and not the brandthe campaign should always promote a respectful and healthy discussion; not a fight or abuse it should present the facts and avoid over-sensitising the issuesno issuecurrent situation should be exploited to a point where it becomes the tone of the firm if a controversy does not settle down early over the time it would become a part of the image of the companythe firm should be always prepared with a contingency plan or a proper response in case if the campaign backfires or does not take the expected courseadvantages of controversial marketing:increasing awareness: a well crafted ad can draw the attention of the unaware audience making them explore the brands’ product portfolio some of them might be potential customersshifting brand image: a brand always needs to evolve as per the needs of its target audience here a controversial marketing strategy could be used to shift the image in a short span it could also define the future path for the brandemotional connect: if a brand is successful in winning the heart of a consumer it half the job is done even if a controversy can divide the audience some will appreciate the message of the brand they will relate more to the brand and can become loyalistsstart a meaningful discussion: particularly if the campaign is designed around a social issue; the campaign not only becomes relevant to the company but also to the society it breaks the stigma around a topic that people frown to talk about by communicating to the masses about such a topic the company eases the air which can lead to healthy discussionsboost sales: the most important aspect if the brand is able to build on the sudden increase in awareness among people it could boost sales and profitability\\xa0disadvantages of controversial marketing:offensive: in present times the audience have become highly sensitive and a controversial ad will definitely offend someone so we have to weigh the benefits and drawbacks before creating something controversialruin brand reputation: as stated earlier it puts a high risk on brand reputation for some consumers a controversy might also become a reason to not buy the product or service specifically in case of media houses if a media house gets involved in controversies often then that reduces their credibilitywhile it can increase the awareness in a short span of time it won’t work in the long run as this attention is short livedinternet they say anything that goes on the internet stays on the internet due to rise of social media people have become more conscious of their choices and try to thoroughly evaluate everything as a result even one controversial campaign will not be forgotten years from now if the company tries to change their opinion on some issue then these old controversies will again come up and harm them deeplya controversial campaign can also attract legal penalties if it ends up leading to disharmony in the societyexamples of controversial marketing strategies:movie makers frequently follow controversy as a tactic to create a buzz around their upcoming movienike came up with “believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything” campaign that had colin kaepernick who was outcast from nfl as he kneeled during national anthem to protest against racial inequality in nfl the ad was a huge success and nike’s sales rose by31%the un’s women’s “auto-complete truth” was a huge success as a campaign and garnered huge accolades from media houses here it focused on gender gap and how it was perceived that some roles could never be donned by womennot all campaigns end in success zomato gathered a lot of backlash in its subtle advertising campaign where they used indian slangs in their banners put up at public placesstarbucks red-cup campaign it created a huge buzz and boosted sales but it drove away a portion of christian customers who were offended by itin the end we can say that controversial marketing is a double-edged sword on one side it benefits the firm by increasing its reach to the masses and making more people conscious about the brand; on the other it puts the brand value itself at stake so it has to be carefully planned and a backup measure should always be kept ready to reduce the impact in case it backfires\\xa0 every such campaign should be thoroughly weighed in for the losses and benefits before executionblackcoffer insights 17:-agnivesh tripathyindian institute of management indore',\n",

              " 'from alibaba to ping an and google to ford companies around the globe are telling staff to figure from directly from home in a bid to stem the spread of covid-19 such remote functioning at scale is unprecedented and can leave a long-lasting impression on the way people live and work for several years to return china which felt the primary impact of the pandemic was an early mover during this space as home to a number of the world’s largest firms it offers lessons for people who are just commencing to embrace the shift working from home skyrocketed in china within the wake of the covid-19 crisis as companies told their employees to remain home around 200 million people were working remotely by the tip of the chinese new year holiday while this arrangement has some benefits like avoiding long commutes many employees and firms found it challenging one employee at a web company quipped his workday changed from ‘996’ to ‘007’ meaning from nine to nine 6 days every week to all or any the time on the private front employees found it difficult to manage kids’ home-schooling via video conference while coordinating with remote colleagues at an organization level many felt that productivity rapidly tailed off if not managed properly if done right remote working can boost productivity and morale; done badly it can breed inefficiency damage work relationships and demotivate employees these kind of things are happening due to the impacts of covid-19 on the world of workhere are a few of the learnings from china that will be applicable around the world looking at the circumstances:designing an effective structure due to the impacts of covid-19 on the world of workteams or whole business units working remotely can quickly end in confusion and a scarcity of clarity being isolated ends up in uncertainty about who to speak to on specific issues and the way and when to approach them resulting in hold-ups and delays that’s why establishing a structure and architecture for deciding and effective communication is vital here smaller cross-functional teams are helpful each with a transparent mission and reporting line where directions and tasks are easy to implement this also simplifies onboarding new hires who can integrate faster in a very tight-knit group at a time when the broad sweep of the organization isn’t visible or easy to feel with fewer in each team there’s longer to urge to understand one another and build the trust that will grow more organically within the office at ping an insurance workers are typically grouped in project teams of at most 30 members while larger business units are divided to assist them to stay agile strong company-wide foundations underpin this like having a typical purpose and unified goals providing clarity on what decisions to escalate and which of them is tackled at the team level helps drive progress to mitigate the consequences of closed retail stores one leading fashion company founded a technique room and redeployed staff into four cross-functional squads to support its front-line it designed standard ways for live broadcasting and established internal best practices to encourage front-line staff to use new retail tools to drive sales remotely\\xa0the lesson: putting in small cross-functional teams with clear objectives and a typical purpose keeps everyone on the identical strategic courseleading from afar due to impacts of covid-19 on the world of workmanaging people is one of the foremost difficult elements of remote working not least because everyone will respond differently to the cultural shift and challenges of the home-working environment leaders have to energize the entire company by setting a transparent direction and communicating it effectively offering a powerful vision and a sensible outlook can have a strong effect on motivation across the organization it’s essential to foster an outcome-driven culture that empowers and holds teams answerable for getting things done while encouraging open honest and productive communication empowering your team in this way pays dividendswesure a part of leading internet company tencent assembled a covid-19 response team5 at the beginning of the year to supply amount freed from charge to front-line medical workersalan lau ceo of wesure credited his team saying that they had worked nonstop many from remote locations while inactive during the chinese new year break demonstrating how responsive they were to the visionfor managers the challenge is to guide inspire and direct their team in their daily course of labor while being physically remote upping the amount of interaction can even work well here one chief information officer responding to a mckinsey survey said he’s texting the whole company with regular updates because it’s a more human way of communicating than via the official corporate channels when working within distributed teams e-commerce giant alibaba increases the frequency of its one-to-one communications with employees to a weekly basis and in some teams members submit a weekly report for his or her colleagues complete with plans for the week ahead alibaba’s productivity app dingtalk (ding ding) has features inbuilt to facilitate this by allowing managers to send voice-to-text messages to their teams and to test in on progressthe lesson: determining how you communicate is simply as important as what’s being said and it has to be done confidently consistently and reliablyinstilling a caring cultureas companies transition to the new normal it’s important to acknowledge that some employees are also facing other pressures reception including caring for his or her children when schools are shut resulting in feelings of isolation and insecurity business leaders must respect and address these additional needs empathy may be a crucial tool here offering how to attach promote inclusiveness and make a way of community in a very barren of physical interaction increasing social interactions within the team particularly through one-on-one catch-up guards against feelings of isolation and demoralization and creates space for people to talk up and share their thoughts by creating a way of psychological safety for his or her colleagues being inclusive in deciding and offering perspective in challenging moments managers can stay closer to what’s occurring surface issues and help their teams solve problems effectively a similar approach is very important when coping with customers and clients providing valuable stability and enabling them to navigate unknown waters confidently as an example one global bank asked their relationship managers to attach with small-business customers via wechat and video calls to know their situation and help them weather the crisis to try and do so effectively at scale the managers are supported through dedicated product programs online articles scripts for communicating with clients and internal training inclusion is that the ultimate show of empathy creating outlets for sharing best practices success stories challenges and water-cooler chat are significant to making a person’s connection giving employees space to pursue personal or social endeavors providing a transparent span of control and assigning meaningful tasks also can spur motivation\\xa0the lesson: connecting on a private level and instilling empathy within the culture is doubly important when working remotelyfinding a new routinemoving to remote working risks disrupting the office-based flows and rhythms and it will be easy to hit the incorrect note or miss important virtual meetings thanks to packed schedules spend time along with your team addressing the nuts and bolts of how you’ll work together cover the daily rhythm individual constraints and specific norms you’ll decide to and anticipate what might get it wrong and the way you’ll mitigate it how companies plan and review their workflows has to change to reflect this the challenges of the new working pattern and of not being in one room together will be overcome by creating a digitally facilitated cadence of meetingsone leading insurance firm adopted agile practices across its teams with a daily and weekly ritual of check-ins sprint planning and review sessions as alibaba embraced remote working it also made sure its meetings were more tightly run one person is assigned to trace time and manage the outcomes team members can rate a meeting’s usefulness by employing a five-star system that gives immediate feedback and positive ways forward to address the challenge of launching a digital business with an oversized remote team one company created a replacement workflow for product requirements that clearly outlined the use of digital tools roles and responsibilities as requirements moved from ideation to validation to delivery stages reiteration of decision-making structures like this isn’t always necessary when people can communicate directly but their absence will be keenly felt when remote working kicks in\\xa0the lesson: establishing robust working norms workflows and features of authority is critical but only too easy to stint onadopting a test and learn the strategy\\xa0the final lesson: being able to recognize what isn’t working and changing it fastthese are the impacts of covid-19 on the world of work leadership teams that continuously learn actively identify best practices and rapidly founded mechanisms to share ideas across the organization tend to be most successful within the future r&d teams at one leading high-tech manufacturer created a productivity target for remote work by estimating their productivity hebdomadally relative to onsite work and identifying levers to enhance it within four weeks they had progressed from 50 percent to 88 percent of their baseline as china’s workforce begins to return to offices these lessons from a number of its leading companies help as an example of how—with the correct structure culture processes and technology—working remotely can boost productivity and morale employees who spend less time traveling or commuting and have a much better work-life balance are likely to be happier more motivated and prepared to mobilize in extreme situations embracing remote working allows companies to define a brand new normal that drives productivity and employee satisfaction into the longer term alibaba launched taobao by now the world’s biggest e-commerce website while the staff was working remotely on quarantine during the 2003 sars outbreak for tripcom an overseas working experiment in 20147 established the foundations for nice customer service and versatile working culture hence bringing together all the weather can enable a brand new

benefits of british rule whatwas the factor that made indians accept thebritish government the perception aboutbritish-policies (about trading pay-scale and positioning in the military) had beendone through various marketing channels in such a way that it brainwashed people of the nation and many were ready to accept the british so the marketing is like fire when smartlyhandled; it can destroy your enemies but when not it can burn you\\xa0 marketing is to design and develop a pathway from product or service to the customer through a product price place and promotion strategies marketing depends on a variety of parameters that can be classified broadly boiling down to vital three these are ‘what type of customer are marketing team is focusing on (based on gender age location customer-class) (w1)’ ‘what are product specification or applications you need to bring in front of customer (w2)’ ‘what is your product promotion flow path (w3)’ ‘how much time it takes to convey product information to customer (h1)’ these criteria are what i call ‘3w1h’ forms these basics need to be taken care of while developing a marketing strategy for the upcoming product however are they enough no there is one more parameter called the feedback mechanism (fm) generally machines use the feedback mechanism to check output generated is as per input is given or not and if it is not the input is corrected to get the required output when it comes to human beings heshe is surrounded by multiple products daily through social media tv advertising and so forth slight uncertainties on either side in observation can make a positive or negative impact on the product on the consumer’s mind in the feedback mechanism the marketing team needs to answer only one question “what kind of product image built in the customer mind through promotional activities” if the product image not built as per expectation then management has to review and work on 3w1h as discussed earlier so let’s elaborate how 3w1h approach works along with feedback mechanism           fig1- 3w1h with fm process can target customer effectively          after deciding the customer range you can work on otheractivities since the customer isconscious about purchasing the product andwhen the product promoted the first thing the customer will check is itsusefulness and if hisher answer is ‘yes’then the customer will start comparing with similar alternative products in themarket therefore one should present theproduct along with some unique thoughtand express the product in such a way that its image imprinted into the consumermind for example the polio campaign inindia the government had taken the initiative to make india polio-free byspreading awareness through all types of social communication mediums in whichtelevision played a vital role legendarycinema actor ‘amitabh bachchan’ was selected as an ambassador for this campaigninitially the advertisement published in which amitabh pleaded people for vaccinatingthe children within a fixed schedule the advertisement circulated throughout the nation andno stone was kept unturned by the governmentto make this campaign successful howevermuch to the surprise advertising failed miserably to attract a deprived community in polio booth this promotion failure was because ofnon-consideration of the customer (w1)and how advertise impacted its application on the customer (w2) so after analysing failure experts recommended changesin their marketing campaign like to focus on major customer (here mainlyvillage woman who generally spend their time in home by watching tv) type ofimpact on people (people who watched tv during that era had an image ofamitabh as ‘angry young man’) so the campaignimproved their advertising by bringing out the same angry amitabh instead ofhis soft-image which used in the earlier campaign so in a very next poliocampaign number of people in the polio booth suddenly increased and whenfeedback is taken from people about such a sudden change they replied that wedon’t want to watch ‘amitabh sir’ getting angry because of us[i]inw3 organisation must focus on what kind of channel use to attract the customer currentlythere are a lot of platforms available bywhich you can market your product the mainagenda you should keep in mind is that how effectively you can engage the customerthrough

\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0forthe last factor (h1) time the obvious question that comes to mind is that ‘is time for advertising matters’ whilewatching the tv when an advertisement appearsmany times we change the channel instead ofwatching the whole ad or ignore it altogether you do have an option of ‘skip ad’ when you watch anything online so one must decide how much time is requiredto deliver product information during itspromotion delivering product informationin less time may create the possibility that the customer will watch it so itcan result in attracting more customers so the content will be theking in the marketing however as onemust have guessed it this will not work all the time other factors like the cost of the productapplication range type of customer can also affectthe h1 for example the customer would bemore conscious while watching higher-pricedproduct broadcast compare to the lower-priced one so it would take more timefor the marketing team to convince thecustomer to buy the expensive good than the lower-priced oneafterimplementing a marketing strategy as per 3w1h we need to work on a feedback mechanism in which organization has to collect information aboutproduct image generated in customer’s minds through dealers and using feedback-form not using the feedback mechanism may lead to failure in achieving‘product sales target’ and can make the situation even worse take the example of ‘the tata nano-making of world’scheapest car’ which was mind-blowing one-of-a-kind projects in indianautomobile industry from the first phase of a marketingcampaign tata nano was on so muchcontinuous limelight that this project was pleased by former american presidentbarack obama[ii]the curiosity about the productwas so high that the sale of then-leadingcar model maruti-800 was dropped by 20% immediately after unveiling the nano[iii]however while marketing the product an organization built “affordable garibo ki car” image in customer’s mindwhich made customers conscious about what will be their status-quo in societyafter buying nano thus they started giving preference to two-wheelers over nano during the same time some instances of nanos catching fire cameinto focus which worsened the situationthis case even exacerbates when the teamdid not work on the feedback mechanismand hence was not able to change customerperception about nano later when nano fire problem was technically sorted outbut even then the marketing team did notmake any impactful effort to market the improved safety of the car therefore customer’s negative perceptionremained stuck and the organization didnot even come close to achieving sellingfigures of nano if the organization had usedfeedback mechanism it would have been an entirely different story so3w1h can be an essential factor whiledeveloping a marketing strategy for theproduct along with a reversible fmmethod this method can help us tomonitor product marketing throughout the phases and can help the marketing team

severe slowdown and on top of that multiple such problems hitting the world of work from many such directions companies and industries are finding it difficult to sustain in such an environment of the financial crisis industries are being urged to take up certain tough decisions like layoff retrenchment compulsive leave without pay and many alternative cost-effective methods to sustain the present economic crisis like cutting down the salaries handing over the pink slip to employees and opting best possible the sudden outbreak has presented new roadblocks for the indian workforce and especially for the daily wage and contractual workersaccording to the latest economy forecast by the un the probability of countries entering into the recession and companies going bankrupt has increased and

an estimated loss of ₹3000 crores a number of young startups have been affected as the funding has fallen and there would be a lack of investors in the market the disruption of the economy is much starker and alarming than the global financial crisis of 2008 which hit the indian financial sector besides that back in 2008 the indian economy was much better placed to handle the crisis according to the data in 2019 the gst collection was expected to be approximately 74 lakh crore while the government was only able to collect a total of 58 lakh crore that is a total loss of 16 lakh crore the government also faced a setback in the income tax sector as the expected revenue to be collected was estimated to 52 lakh crore but the government faced a shortfall of 50000 crores the above discrepancies have resulted in insufficient funds with the government clearly the government does not have sufficient funds to provide relief to the people mainly the labor class contractual workers and the people working on the basis of daily wages other major industries whose figures of losses are alarming are the hospitality and tourism industry which employs approx 4 crore people in the next 10-12 months it expects 12 lakh job losses which may act as a major factor in revenue lo and revenue losses of ₹11000 crores the aviation industry is worth ₹22 lakh crore employing 35 lakh people they

percent of indian businesses indicate the marked impact of the coronavirus pandemic on business operations even at early stages” the tourism and travel industry has been hit most whose operations have almost come down to zero the second most hit sector is manufacturing and with a significant portion of the unorganized sector being employed there the situation worsens healthcare and hygiene products like mouth masks sanitizers and handwash have become expensive due to excessive demandwith the present ongoing situation the followingsthings can be predicted:the medicines and healthcare costs are expected to increase in the future as india imports 69% of the raw material of pharmaceutical drugs and due to lockdown in both countries the supply route has been fragmented drastically this is also evident with the recent increase in common use medicines like paracetamol whose cost has gone up by 40% as per the latest crisil reportindustries depending on cheap labor could take a hit as such pandemics are more prone to populated countries and the factory workers and unorganized sectors don’t have access to healthcare benefits so the cases might just shoot up drastically and their attendance in the future will go down in the same rate inverselysmartphones and electronics sales will be affected directly in china the sale of smartphones is expected to go down by 50% as stores are in lockdown for a long time new launch events are getting postponed or canceled and since china is the largest smartphone manufacturer in the world with 1 out of every 4 smartphones shipped from china

the shock persists and even though the initial growth is resumed but there is some permanent loss of output this was the case with the usa post-2008 crisis this was led by a deep banking crisis that

with increased loss of output leaving lasting structural damage to the economywith the recent cut of india’s growth projections by moody’s and fitch the future indicates a deeper slowdown if not recession to come out of this pandemic cleanly and with lesser shocks the government needs to set its priorities right- with prime focus right now on the medical and healthcare sector as the country is battling against the coronavirus but along with that the government should try to take along the lower sections of the society providing them monetary gains as they are the one who is battling with the daily necessities along with the virus in the long term the government should keep an eye on the issue of liquidity to keep the cycle going but above all this we as a responsible citizen

              " 'disruption in fintech – the lightning networkblockchain or the distributed ledger technology hasalready been around for some time now cryptocurrencies like bitcoin based onthe blockchain technology are making entry into the formal finance world andincreasingly becoming a medium for exchange though there are many potentialuse cases for cryptocurrencies and the indian government is very critical aboutimplementing the technology in banking and finance it still has a lot ofissues to be resolved before we can commercially use it for transactions some of the most important drawbacks ofcryptocurrencies like bitcoin right now are as below:scalability:bitcoin can have <7 transactions per second as compared to ~47000 via payment network giants like visathere is a block limit of 1mb which amounts to 8gbs per 10 min on a bitcoin block (to match 47000 transactions per second) this essentially means that home computers cannot process this currently and it has very limited use cases with transactions requiring devices having the high computational powercentralization:high computation power requirement would limit the usage of the network to only those who can afford itthis will eventually lead to fewer validations for the distributed ledger defeating the whole purpose of using blockchain (a distributed ledger means that everyone in the network can validate the transaction between two parties)so it becomes important to have a cheaply availablevalidation mechanism that can be carried out using a basic broadband connectionin-homesmall business computers if two people have personal transactionhistory it’s unimportant that it should be posted on the main blockchain everytime a transaction takes place as it could bloat up the blockchain moreovereveryday transactions using cryptocurrency is not possible as the cost ofposting a transaction for let’s say buying a coffee can be more than theprice of coffee itselfintroducing the lightning network:lightning network is the latest disruptive technologybeing researched currently in fintech to make cryptocurrencies scalable itbasically addsan extra layer on top of the main bitcoin blockchain and enables paymentchannels between two parties over this layer micropayments for everydaytransactions can be very easily carried out using this channel here is how itworks:suppose a buys a coffeefrom the nearby coffee shop b daily on her way to work a and b decide to opena channel on the blockchain for their everyday transactions once the channel(or the lightning network) is open the two parties can keep a track of theirdaily transactions on this ledger at the end of the month with the ledgerreflecting balances left with each party they decide to close the channelthis final transaction is then recorded on the main bitcoin blockchain thisreduces the cost of the transaction and enables micropayments for everydaytransactions\\xa0 micropayment channels can defer updating the mainblockchain with remaining balances at a later date a large network ofmicropayments can be created as a secondary layer on top of the main blockchainto address the scalability issue and reduce transaction fees although this solutionis very much in the initial stages resolving the scalability issue andreducing transaction fees by taking the transaction out of the main blockchainwill give a big boost to the use of cryptocurrencieshow do payments take place on the lightning networkthe two parties exchange a single key for validationof their spend transactions they can conduct an unlimited number of transactionson this channel and finally when one party closes the channel the balanceswill be added to the blockchaineachuser can open a digital wallet to store bitcoins and deposit some coins in itonce the channel is opened (this money is kind of a security deposit on behalfof both the parties to honor their transaction)oncethey need to exchange money after their books are updated they can sign offthe ledger in the channelfinallythis will be added to the blockchain once the channel is closedthe network is globally scalable since to reach anyperson through connected channels network you just need to know the path toconnect to that person through leveraging your existing network once thenetwork develops in future the requirement to open a separate channel toowould cease to exist since the algorithm will automatically find the shortestroute to connect to the person whom you want to pay based on the exhaustivepeer to peer network this would ease inter-country transactions and money canbe sent across internationally within secondslimitations of the technology –since the channel for lightning network is separate and not connected with the main blockchain it will not be backed by the security of the original blockchain this can be a major concern for its widespread adoption and the companies should research extensively into this another challenge is its dependency on the internet the lightning network is not capable of storing coins digitally in a hardware wallet this makes it prone to hackers since the wallet will be available online also transferring large amounts of money is something that needs further detailed research since bigger payment might struggle with routing in the networknevertheless this technology is really fascinating and has a very broad usage through the implementation of bitcoins and distributed ledger in everyday life once this is rolled out for customer experience micropayments will be possible between two parties on blockchain just as we currently have wallets to transfer money for small purchases the lightning network has a long way to go and is surely going to become the next big disruption in fintech domain

in developed countries such as the us reducing healthcare cost is an agenda point of all the politicians\\xa0 even in india affordable healthcare will be as important as “roti kapda and makan” in the near future technology can play a big role in reducing healthcare cost and making it more efficient the vast quantity of data is available with hospitals and insurance providers big data can play a big role in analyzing this data to produce actionable insight some of the benefits of using big data are as followsreduce fraud and waste: fraud has a bigimpact on everyone in fact the national healthcare anti-fraud associationestimates that fraud costs americans at least $33 billion to $55 billionannually – that’s approximately 3-5% of the nation’s health care spending of$226 trillion for example: sometimes providers or hospitals reportprocedures or services that were never provided big data analytics can help an insurance company to discover these frauds big data can use a huge amount of historical data to identify expected procedure or service for reported illness (identified using diagnosis code) if the expected procedure code doesn’t match with a billed procedure code insurance companies can tag claim as a potential fraud claim once a claim is tagged as a fraud claim the manual examiner needs to do additional verification to ensure that the claim is submitted by fraud providersometimes patients’ fake identity to get the benefit of insurance using big data companies can match patients’ information with services heshe has taken if services taken by the patient is very different from the past medical history of patients analytics can tag claim as one of the susceptible fraud claimsstoring of data:traditional health care providers find it difficult to store a vast amount of data more ever traditional database stores only structured data big data can solve storage issue by handling huge volume and variety of data having historical data of the patient can reduce healthcare drastically improving scheduling of appointments:it is very tough to get a physician’s appointment in developed countries one of my friends senior director in a multinational bank got an appointment for hip replacement surgery with a waiting period of six months he was not able to sit and as a result he didn’t drive or come to the office for six months the waiting period can be drastically reduced if the hospital is able to forecast the number of patients likely to miss appointments based on historical data hospitals can predict the number of no shows and can accordingly schedule appointments so as not to miss any slot because of no showsreducing overpayment and underpayment made tohospital:if a health insurance company pays an amount to hospitalprovider that is greater than the contracted amount for service payment is called an overpayment similarly if payment made is lesser than the contracted amount for service payment is called an underpayment overpayment or underpayment is a big headache for both insurance companies and patients according to aha data private insurance companies have consistently overpaid hospitals for inpatient care for more than three decades these overpayments have varied significantly over the years but have grown dramatically in the past few years overpayment or underpayment can happen because of multiple reasons such as system glitch a coding error using cognitive analysis big data can predict the payment amount if the predicted payment amount is significantly different than the actual payment amount the system can identify possible overpayments or underpayments predictive treatment:throughout the world healthcare is based on diagnosing the presence of disease and subsequently treating the disease if present early diagnosis of the illness is a major challenge patients do go for diagnosis only when the symptom is evident\\xa0 it becomes challenging for the physician to treat illness once illness grows beyond a certain levelpredictive or preventive can help to identify if an individual will develop a disease different forms of health device such as iwatch can capture data and send to the hospital at regular interval of time using predictive analysis the hospital can predict if a patient is likely to develop an illness early diagnosis of illness can help doctors to treat patients effectively and at a lower cost predictive treatment can reduce the number of days a patient needs to be admitted in the hospital as inpatient treatment is costlier than outpatient treatment doctors can discharge patients if heshe thinks that the condition of the patient is not serious the hospital can monitor the patient remotely using medical sensors and can call the patient to the hospital when it is required big data plays a big role when a person suffers from multiple illnesses as per dr abhishek rai ms ortho of kem medical college mumbai “it becomes challenging to operate patients when he suffers from multiple illnesses many a number of times physicians are not aware of all issues with patients as patients themselves are not aware of all illness” as an example it’s tough to operate on a person suffering from diabetes as blood doesn’t coat easily for a diabetic person\\xa0 if a physician doesn’t have historical data of a diabetic person heshe may operate diabetic person wrongly another example where big data analytics can play a huge role in predicting disease is a genetic disease if a person has breast cancer her child is 15-20 percent likely to develop breast cancer using big data analytics the system can identify patients likely to suffer from genetic disease and request patients to do timely screening genetic diseases can be screened in first second- or third-degree relatives to reduce the morbidity and mortality\\xa0 timely diagnostic reports:in india it takes 2-3 days on an average to get an mri scan delay is not because of lack of medical instruments but because of lack of qualified radiologists this problem can be mitigated by integrating medical imaging with big data integration of medical imaging with big data will ensure that radiologists get the report in a short span of time big data will help not only to reduce the turnaround time required to get reports but also to get better reports technology can convert image to graphs and charts making it easier for radiologists to read the report as data works on the principle of abundance instead of scarcity so the more data we have the better the outcomes can be obtained thus big data technology

              " 'big datato begin with i shall first like to explain what big data is and why it has become so important in our lives big data is simply data but with a huge size data that is not just voluminous but also growing exponentially with time such data sets are so large and complex that it is not possible to store or process them using traditional data management tools so how huge can this data be social media sites like facebook generate more than 500 terabytes of new data every day in the form of photos video uploads text messages etc a single\\xa0jet engine\\xa0can generate\\xa0more than 10 terabytes\\xa0of data in\\xa030 minutes\\xa0of flight time with many thousand flights per day generation of data reaches up to many\\xa0petabytes data contained in these sets are not always structured it can be semi-structured or even unstructured when such is the size and dimension of data we can well imagine how complicated it must be to process and analyze it therefore modern methods of data analysis are being developed and used to process the information contained in big data setsopportunities  now coming to the opportunities that big data provides they are not just limited to healthcare big data analysis is now a disruptive technology which has intervened into numerous fields and proved its worth healthcare is no exception big data has the potential to change the entire dynamics of the healthcare industry and improve the quality of life of people healthcare industry is a very large and complicated system it involves a lot of risks and always demands better care however when a large number of patients seek emergency care the complications as well as the cost rise exponentially in india many times we even lack sufficient infrastructure to support the patients there is a deficit of beds as well as doctors to provide treatment to the patients for instance when epidemics break out and lives are lost at a very alarming rate we can easily gauge our helplessness however the scenario is certainly improving now with the advent of digitization into the healthcare system healthcare providers or practitioners are now having access to a huge amount of patient health data this healthcare big data can be processed and analyzed to identify patient patterns more quickly and effectively the information obtained can be extremely useful to figure out chronic health issues and provide preventive treatment plans well beforehand so as to curb that disease or disorder from occurring this method is also known as predictive analysis and it is one of the most crucial benefits of big data in healthcare this technology can help the healthcare industry in more ways than we can infer healthcare organizations that have implemented predictive analysis have witnessed a reduction in er visits by providing support and care to patients and decreasing emergency situationsapart from reduced er visits and timely treatment there are many other benefits of big data and predictive analysis patients with high-risk life-threatening issues can be provided with more customized treatment facilities due to lack of data there exists a lack of proper planning in hospitals under or over-booking of staff lack of medical equipment medicines and other facilities are a result of inefficient budgeting and ill-management of finances using predictive analysis these problems can be solved which will lead to reduced costs and efficient management of finances better staff allocation and admission rate prediction shall facilitate improvement in daily operations of healthcare organizations by using big data the effect of recency bias could be reduced as well when we give more importance to recent events and tend to ignore the effect of the older ones it may lead to incorrect decisions this is known as recency bias big data also helps in preventing fraudulent activities which in turn prevents losses of insurance companies challenges  while all of this is changing the healthcare industry for the better it is not that easy to reap the benefits of big data there are a whole lot of challenges and vulnerabilities attached to its implementation one of the biggest challenges is security healthcare big data contains the personal information and health history of patients acts of hacking cyber theft and phishing pose a serious threat to these databases such data could be stolen and sold for huge sums of money protection of the patients’ privacy hence is a serious challenge to big data implementation also the data would contain external data apart from medical information the organization therefore has to take care of privacy legal compliances and government policies privacy and security of patients have to be given utmost importance and no breach of any kind can be permittedthe next challenge is data classification and modeling the size of the data is massive and it is less structured and heterogeneous classifying such massive data to identify relevant information is a big challenge modeling of such unstructured data is equally difficult storage and retrieval is another major challenge huge cloud servers with sufficient space are required to store such voluminous data also the speed should be high so that uploading of data can be done hassle-free the way storage is a challenge retrieval also is a matter of concern integrating the data and getting all relevant systems to link each other is a tough job the next challenge is a major one in my opinion finding the righttalent who own the expertise to implement this modern technology is an arduoustask shortage of required talent is a crisis in the market today even afterhiring the right talent it is a challenge to retain them scarce resources likedata scientists are hard to find and even harder to retain they are easilypoached by competitors a good and efficient compensation strategy conducivework environment high incentives opportunities for career growth and developmentcan be some of the ways of retaining such intellectual talent in a nutshell we can conclude that while big data is a disruptive technology which will bring about landmark changes in healthcare dynamics the challenges and vulnerabilities need to be addressed with the utmost care and sense of responsibilityblackcoffer insights 10 | subhasmita dey xavier school of human resource
